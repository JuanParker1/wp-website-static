<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">In this blog, we will take a dive into how the APIMatic Kubernetes Operator actually runs along with the methods to deploy it within the APIMatic environment.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Running the APIMatic Kubernetes Operator</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">For running the APIMatic Kubernetes operator, you need to go through some steps and requirements. First of all, contact APIMatic at </span><b>support@apimatic.io</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to register with the APIMatic CodeGen Docker Hub registry and acquire a valid license to run the APIMatic CodeGen API. Moreover, you need to install:</span></p>
<ol class="">
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://golang.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Go language</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400">version v1.16.*</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://git-scm.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Git</span></a></li>

</ol>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">How to Deploy the Kubernetes Operator?</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the initial requirements are complete, you can proceed to deploy the APIMatic Kubernetes operator via the methods:</span></p>
<ul class="">
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Direct Deployment of Operator</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">OLM Deployment of Operator (will be covered in our next blog soon&#8230;)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Direct Deployment of Operator</span></h3>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Direct deployment is an instant deployment to those instances that are externally accessible. To run the operator via direct deployment, start off by cloning the APIMatic repository into your working directory using the </span><b>git clone</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> command.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/apimatic/apimatic-kubernetes-operator.git</code></pre>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Next, run the </span><b>make deploy </b><span style="font-weight: 400">command to set up the APIMatic operator resources. This will deploy the </span><b>apimatic-system</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> namespace as well as the </span><b>CRD</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the </span><b>RBAC</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> manifests. Following this, create a secret, named </span><b>apimaticimagesecret, </b><span style="font-weight: 400">with </span><b>kubectl create secret</b><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;command which allows pulling the APIMatic CodeGen image using the Docker Hub username registered with APIMatic.</span></p>
<pre class=""><code class="language-bash">kubectl create secret docker-registry apimaticimagesecret --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ --
docker-username=&lt;your-name&gt; --docker-password=&lt;your-pword&gt; --docker-email=&lt;your-email&gt;</code></pre>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, create a </span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/"><span style="font-weight: 400">configmap</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400">resource named </span><b>apimaticlicense, </b><span style="font-weight: 400">with the </span><b>kubectl create configmap</b><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;command, that will serve as the volume storing the APIMatic license. For example,the following command creates a ConfigMap and deploys it using the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">License.lic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> file located at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">/usr/local/apimatic/license/</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">kubectl create configmap apimaticlicense --from-file /usr/local/apimatic/license/License.lic</code></pre>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">After running the operator using the following </span><b>kubectl apply</b><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;command, you will see a newly created </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Deployment</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> with a replica count of 3 and </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Service</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> of type NodePort, both named </span><b>apimatic-sample</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Accessing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">http://localhost:32000/</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> from your browser (or using curl from within the Minikube or Kind cluster) will show the APIMatic Titan page.</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">kubectl apply -f config/samples/apicodegen_v1beta1_apimatic.yaml</code></pre>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Once done with all the above, you can use the exposed APIMatic CodeGen API to generate API SDKs and Docs using </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://curl.se/"><span style="font-weight: 400">curl</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">, Postman, or your own custom Web application that consumes the APIMatic CodeGen API service. You can also remove the APIMatic resources using the </span><b>make undeploy</b><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;command.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">For detailed information, please visit our </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://docs.apimatic.io/kubernetes-operator/direct-deployment-of-operator/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Direct Deployment APIMatic Docs</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Setting up a containerized application may not be difficult for API users but is definitely a workout. This is largely because </span><span style="font-weight: 400">containerization</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, the principle approach that Kubernetes is built upon, is still not nearly as ubiquitous as the classical approach to API design and resource management. Therefore, APIMatic Kubernetes Operator has been introduced as yet another option </span><a href="http://apimatic.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">amongst our developing toolset</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> so that you can get up and running with APIMatic on your own infrastructure.</span></p>

<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">How can you reduce client onboarding of your API so that the API user quickly gets to their first &#8220;Hello World&#8221;?</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">One definitive way is to provide an SDK for a developer&#8217;s technology stack so that they can easily integrate your APIs onto their native platforms.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> By providing an SDK, it becomes much simpler for a developer to integrate your API in ways that are familiar and well-integrated with their existing toolchain</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">In simpler terms, it is no longer enough to expose your API endpoints with just HTTP documentation or API references. You need to attract developers to enable them to comfortably play around with your code, and this is what APIMatic SDKs help with.</span></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">APIMatic as a Code Generator</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://www.apimatic.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">APIMatic</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> autogenerates SDKs </span><span style="font-weight: 400">f</span><span style="font-weight: 400">or APIs automatically in all major programming languages so that developers can consume APIs in their favorite development environment with less code, less effort, and more fun</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">These </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/overview-sdks/"><span style="font-weight: 400">comprehensive SDKs</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> help accelerate the API consumption process as they can be automatically generated and shipped along with your latest API update. They accurately map your API definition files into their respective classes and controllers while adhering to the best coding practices. APIMatic further provides flexibility to customize code generation through </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/configure-codegen/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Customizable CodeGen Settings</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. APIMatic generates SDKs in the following languages:</span></p>
<ul class="">
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">PHP</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ruby</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Python</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">C# (.NET)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Java</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">TypeScript</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Building and maintaining these feature-packed SDKs from scratch is not easy and requires extensive engineering time and effort. However, autogenerated SDKs can significantly cut down costs and time.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">For more detailed pros and cons of manually generating SDKs against autogenerating them, read here on </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://www.apimatic.io/blog/2021/09/the-great-sdk-battle-build-vs-buy/"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Great SDK Battle: Build vs Buy</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">How does APIMatic Autogenerate SDKs?</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">SDK generation is a tricky challenge for API providers. On one side, you want to keep SDKs with minimal code and dependencies and on the other hand, you want to customize the generated code according to the needs of the developers. APIMatic gives you an easy solution by providing autogenerated SDKs for your APIs.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">APIMatic’s Code Generation Engine follows several steps internally to generate client libraries from API definition files. The code generation process starts with an input API definition file which can be in any of the multiple supported </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://www.apimatic.io/transformer/#supported-formats"><span style="font-weight: 400">API definition formats</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> like OpenAPI, RAML, API Blueprint, etc.</span></p>
<ul class="">
<li><b>API Transformation: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">This step transforms the input API definition file into APIMatic&#8217;s format which contains useful information for SDK generation that is not available in other API definition formats.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>API Validation:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400">After an input file is transformed into APIMatic’s format, it is validated. The validation process includes checking for syntactical and semantical discrepancies in the API definition and shows critical warnings and errors to be fixed before SDK generation can proceed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>SDK Generation: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, components of the API definition are looped over to generate code representations. While a basic SDK caters to settings, endpoints, and an abstraction layer, APIMatic goes an extra step by mapping your API completely into an SDK</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Some important entity conversions from an API definition to an SDK are:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Settings -&gt; Configuration files:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> All API settings like environment configuration etc are consolidated in a configuration file.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Endpoints -&gt; Functions:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Each endpoint maps onto an independent function.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Groups -&gt; Controller class files:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Endpoints are automatically grouped into separate Controller classes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Models -&gt; Model class files:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Data input is converted into models.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Errors -&gt; Exception class files:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Errors are handled as exceptions via a unified exception class.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp; &nbsp; Apart from these core files, the CodeGen engine also generates the following utility files:</span></p>
<ul class="">
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul class="">
<li style="font-weight: 400;text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;HTTP abstraction layer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;Helper class files</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Client library interface</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Language/platform-dependent files</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Documentation Generation: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Every generated SDK also includes a README.md file. The README contains complete class reference and code samples for the SDK and guides the user on setting up the environment (using tool-specific IDEs), initializing the client, creating the controller, calling the endpoints, and testing them.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Packaging:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400">After all the SDK files have been generated, there are multiple packaging options available to APIMatic users. You can either get the SDK packaged in a zip file, have it deployed to GitHub, or </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/publishing-a-package/"><span style="font-weight: 400">publish it as a package</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> on platforms like npm, NuGet, RubyGems, and PyPI.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">For more detail on the mapping from an API specification file to SDK, please refer to the </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/overview-sdks/"><span style="font-weight: 400">APIMatic SDK O</span>verview</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Features Supported in APIMatic&#8217;s Autogenerated SDKs&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">APIMatic SDKs supports the latest versions and language dependencies, along with features that make them as robust and fault-tolerant as possible.</span></p>
<p class=""><strong>Immutable Clients for Multi-Threading</strong></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">An</span><a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/changelog/apimatic-code-generator-v3-titan#new-immutable-clients-in-sdks"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Immutable Client</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> does not allow the user of the client to mutate the client (i.e change its state) once it has been created.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Client classes of all the SDKs are designed using the immutable design pattern. This gives developers the assurity that no method call would mutate its state once the client is instantiated.</span></p>
<p class=""><strong>Timeout and Retries on API Call Errors</strong></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">APIMatic generated SDKs help you write fault-tolerant applications by helping deal with network fault errors. If an API call fails due to network problems, it is retried with an exponentially increasing wait time up to a maximum retry count specified by the user.

<p class=""><strong>Support for XML in API Calls</strong></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">The SDKs contain support for </span><a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/changelog/apimatic-code-generator-v3-titan#support-for-xml"><span style="font-weight: 400">sending and receiving XML</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the API calls, alongside JSON. So if your API definition uses XML, it can be imported into APIMatic to generate SDKs without having to worry about serializing and deserializing the XML data.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""><strong>oneOf and anyOf Support</strong></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Java, Python, and PHP SDKs contain the support of <strong>oneOf</strong> and <strong>anyOf</strong> which gives the ability to create a complex schema or validate a value against multiple criteria.</span></p>
<p class=""><strong>Support for Nullable Properties in Models</strong></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">J</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ava and C# SDKs contain nullable properties in models, so if a user does not assign any value to a property after model instance initialization, a null value will be sent in the HTTP request instead of being skipped altogether.</span></p>
<p class=""><strong>Access to HTTP Response Data</strong></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">The SDKs also allow access to the HTTP response information like response headers, status code, and body on API calls. </span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Other features in the SDKs include optimized error messages, handling cancellation of API calls, and more.

<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Wrapping it Up!</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Creating SDKs in multiple languages is quite resource-intensive and expensive. Good SDKs save both time and cognitive effort when integrating with a provider’s API. This is why APIMatic&#8217;s CodeGen engine gives you the maximum advantage in creating SDKs and takes care of all the SDK generation and maintenance work behind the scenes while your developers can focus on their applications and innovative solutions.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3 id="d6de"><strong>Updated Language Versions, Dependencies, and Adherence to Coding Standards</strong></h3>
<p id="7773" class="">To ensure SDK compatibility with the maximum user codebase, the SDKs have been refactored to target minimum language and runtime versions and updated dependencies. Moreover, we have applied the latest industry-accepted <a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/sdk-coding-standards">coding standards</a> in all languages to the SDKs.</p>
<h3 id="cb43" class="">Immutable Clients for Multi-Threading</h3>

<h3 id="c83a" class="">Timeout and Retries on API Call Errors</h3>
<p id="ecc0" class="">All APIMatic SDKs now support handling <a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/changelog/apimatic-code-generator-v3-titan#timeout-and-automatic-retries-on-api-call-errors">timeouts and automatic retries</a> if an API call is timing out, is unreachable, or returning API call errors.</p>
<h3 id="fe34" class="">Support for XML in API Calls</h3>
<p id="3a23" class="">All SDKs now come with the added support for <a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/changelog/apimatic-code-generator-v3-titan#support-for-xml">sending and receiving XML</a>&nbsp;in the API calls. So if your API definition uses XML, it can be imported into APIMatic v3 to generate SDKs without having to worry about serializing and deserializing the XML data.</p>

<p class=""><em>This blog is the fifth part of the series called “API Transformer Recipes”.

<p id="3e6f" class="">You can find numerous debates out there on the topic of “SOAP vs REST” including those that believe&nbsp; REST is the new SOAP.&nbsp;Depending on your service and its target consumers, it might actually be a good idea (albeit rarely) to provide that service in the form of both SOAP and REST APIs. Sounds like an awful load of work? Perhaps not. Let’s dig deeper.</p>

<h2 class=""><strong>Is REST not enough?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="e560" class="">A lot of businesses today have adapted the RESTful approach for their services as it provides a more flexible, lightweight, and efficient solution as compared to the other available alternatives. While this holds true for most cases, there can be times when you’ll find your clients (especially enterprises) seeking a SOAP service to integrate with. Some of the reasons for that can be:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="">
<li>Being slow adopters, enterprise clients might be reluctant to shift to REST since it is still a relatively newer approach to things and differs greatly from the rigid contract-based approach used by SOAP.</li>
<li>Tools and infrastructure used by enterprise clients may not yet support REST well.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="0855">Keeping this in mind, it may be useful to expose your REST service partially/completely in the form of a SOAP service as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h2 class=""><strong>Real-life Use Cases</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="d89b" class=""><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/in/?ir=1">Salesforce</a>&nbsp;provides some APIs as both SOAP and REST allowing developers to integrate in a way that suits them best e.g. check out their&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_tooling.meta/api_tooling/intro_api_tooling.htm">Tooling API</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="7b09" class="">One of our clients at APIMatic,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdq.ch/">CDQ AG</a>, is a data centric company. Their RESTful services provide a link between their cloud services and business applications. To facilitate smooth integration for enterprise customers, whose infrastructure does not support REST well, they have exposed the same APIs as SOAP services/WSDL interfaces too. This WSDL serves as a contract for both parties. To keep their REST and SOAP APIs in sync, they have integrated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apimatic.io/transformer/">API Transformer</a>&nbsp;into their workflow which helps generate a new version of the WSDL for every change in their REST API (more on this later). With the newer WSDL, they update their SOAP service accordingly and in order to access the latest changes their service consumers also eventually update their applications based on this latest WSDL.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h3 class=""><strong>SOAP and WSDL</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="076c" class="">While it is not mandatory for every SOAP service to have a WSDL file associated with it, it is widely used as a contract between the SOAP service provider and its consumer. This file provides a complete definition of how the service works, the various operations involved and other fine grain details of all elements and attributes involved. Many tools exist that lets you generate method stubs in almost any language if you have the WSDL file with you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h3><strong>From REST to SOAP, Using API Transformer</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="1af0" class="">One of the less obvious but distinctive features of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apimatic.io/transformer/">API Transformer</a>&nbsp;is its ability to convert REST APIs to SOAP by generating WSDL files from popular formats used to describe REST APIs like OpenAPI/Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, etc. We’ve seen, on average, over 50 unique transformations (unique per user) to WSDL every month for the past three years since this feature was launched.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figcaption></figcaption>
Note, however, that the REST APIs spoken of here include not only APIs that completely follow REST architecture style but also those that follow more of a hybrid approach between REST and RPC style.</figure>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h2><strong>Generating WSDL from REST &#8212; How does this work?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="7341" class="">I went ahead and created a sample OpenAPI&nbsp;<code>v3.0</code>&nbsp;file which I then converted to WSDL using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apimatic.io/transformer/">API Transformer</a>. Using these files, I will now show you the inner workings of the conversion below. If you are interested to see the complete files, you can find them<a href="https://github.com/fariadev22/api-transformer-recipes/tree/master/Exposing%20a%20SOAP%20API%20Using%20REST">here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h3 class=""><strong>1. API Information</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="14f8">During the conversion, details related to the API like its identifying title, description and server URLs are extracted from the OpenAPI file and placed in the relevant service metadata of WSDL.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class=""><strong><em>OpenAPI:</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<pre class=""><code class="language-json">openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: HelloService
  description: Swagger file for generating WSDL
version: &#039;1.0&#039;
servers:
  - url: https://www.example.com/SayHello/</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><strong><em>WSDL:</em></strong> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<pre class=""><code class="language-xml">&lt;service name=&quot;HelloService&quot;&gt;
  &lt;documentation&gt;Swagger file for generating WSDL&lt;/documentation&gt;
  &lt;port name=&quot;default_Port&quot; binding=&quot;wsdl:HelloService_Binding&quot;&gt;
    &lt;soap:address location=&quot;https://www.example.com/SayHello/&quot; xmlns:soap=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/port&gt;
&lt;/service&gt;</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h3 class=""><strong>2. OpenAPI Paths</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class="">Generally, the relative paths in OpenAPI help identify RESTful resources and associated with each of these paths are the various operations possible on these resources. However, these paths have no significance in SOAP/WSDL because the concept of resources is restricted to RESTful APIs only. Only their associated operations are converted to WSDL operations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h3 class=""><strong>3. OpenAPI Operations vs WSDL Operations</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->WSDL operations are defined in an abstract way inside the port types and their concrete details are provided in the bindings. Information from OpenAPI operations is loaded into both these port types and binding operations. <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h4 id="1625"><strong>HTTP Verb</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="53c0" class="">An OpenAPI operation has a distinct HTTP verb associated with it e.g.&nbsp;<code>GET</code>,&nbsp;<code>POST</code>,&nbsp;<code>DELETE</code>, etc. indicating the type of functionality that is expected to be performed on the resource. All OpenAPI operations are converted to&nbsp;<code>POST</code>&nbsp;methods for SOAP/WSDL conversion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h4 id="722f" class=""><strong>WSDL Operation Name</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="2f34" class="">The operation name for WSDL is generated by combining the HTTP verb and operation id/name from the OpenAPI operation and serves as a unique identifier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figcaption>Input parameters are wrapped and sent in SOAP body</figcaption>
</figure>
<!-- /wp:image --></div>
<!-- /wp:column -->

<!-- wp:column -->
<div class="wp-block-column"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="4d93">All associated request parameters of an OpenAPI operation are wrapped in a single new input type and sent in the form of an&nbsp;<strong>input message</strong>&nbsp;in the SOAP body. The wrapper input type’s name is generated by combining the original HTTP verb of the operation with the operation’s id and a postfix indicating it as the input type.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="cd0f" class="">Unlike JSON, a root XML element cannot be an array. So even if only a single parameter is involved, a wrapper type helps preserve all type related information of it including array representations that would otherwise be lost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->In the WSDL example above, note the use of the&nbsp;<code>message</code>&nbsp;attribute in&nbsp;<code class="">&lt;input&gt;</code>&nbsp;that provides a link to the concrete&nbsp;<code>&lt;message&gt;</code>&nbsp;definition in WSDL. <!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>
<!-- /wp:column --></div>
<!-- /wp:columns -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h4 id="3f92"><strong>Operation Responses</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="7661">The first success response definition (of the range 2XX) is also wrapped in a new output type which defines the body of the&nbsp;<strong>output message</strong>&nbsp;received. The type name is generated in a similar fashion as that of the input type except for the postfix which indicates it as an output type.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="5e1e" class="">Error responses of the range 400 and above are considered SOAP&nbsp;<strong>faults</strong>. Note, however, that response code has no significance in WSDL.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="6fa3">Again, note the use of the&nbsp;<code>message</code>&nbsp;attribute in&nbsp;<code>&lt;output&gt;</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>&lt;fault&gt;</code>&nbsp;that provides a link to the concrete&nbsp;<code>&lt;message&gt;</code>&nbsp;definition in WSDL.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h4 id="0c7e"><strong>SOAP Binding Transport Protocol</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="739a" class="">SOAP binding transport protocol is assumed to be HTTP for the conversion. Since SOAP supports other transport protocols as well, this can be modified manually if required.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h3><strong>4. WSDL Messages</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="ae44" class="">WSDL messages defined using the&nbsp;<code>&lt;message&gt;</code>&nbsp;tag help describe the data being exchanged between the service provider and the client. Request messages are associated with the&nbsp;<code>&lt;input&gt;</code>&nbsp;tag while response messages are associated with the&nbsp;<code>&lt;output&gt;</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>&lt;fault&gt;</code>&nbsp;tag. Different parts of a message define its components and help provide a link to their concrete type schema definitions.</p>

<h3><strong>5. OpenAPI Schema and XML Schema</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="5503">Schema definitions from OpenAPI are added to the XML schema(s) in WSDL&nbsp;<code>&lt;types&gt;</code>&nbsp;section. These not only include the types defined globally in OpenAPI&nbsp;<code>schema</code>&nbsp;definitions but also additional types that represent the wrapped request/response messages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="490a" class="">In OpenAPI, you can fine-tune your schema definitions to represent XML types by adding<a href="https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/representing-xml/">XML metadata</a>&nbsp;like information about namespace, prefix, XML node name, whether the property is an attribute or not, etc. Let’s have a look at how an OpenAPI schema defined with these attributes translates to a type in WSDL during the conversion.</p>

<h2 id="b148">You have the WSDL — What next?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="6f9f" class="">Having a WSDL basically means, you have a skeleton of what your SOAP service will look like. Various tools and frameworks can then help you accelerate actual implementation of the SOAP service by generating stubs. However, before you start implementing, you need to decide whether you plan to keep the SOAP service independent from your existing REST service or not. The former case will have bigger maintenance cost and it will be difficult to keep both services in sync when changes occur. The recommended way is to implement this SOAP service more as a proxy service that handles SOAP payloads but converts them to those compatible with your existing REST service. This way your actual service will still be the REST service while the SOAP service will help facilitate the smaller chunk of your customers like enterprises. What option you pick is something you are the best judge of.</p>

<p id="9c8b" class="">While APIs form an important part of modern software development, it’s crucial to ensure that the utility offered by an API does not come at the cost of hindered productivity. Often it takes developers multiple hours to get familiar with an API before they can start building and integrating with it, however, a great developer experience can ensure developers get started with the least of steps and minimal time. In this blog, we will discuss how code samples help contribute towards an outstanding developer experience. We will discuss in detail what makes good samples, the different styles of samples, and how samples gel in with documentation and other elements to form a formidable developer experience.</p>
<h2 id="74b0" class="">Part I: Code Samples — Why Should We Care?</h2>
<p id="6565" class="">Learning new technologies is a complex task, even for the savviest of developers. Often it requires them to go through in-depth documentation, guides, and tutorials, something which they are very keen to skip on. What code samples do instead, is provide them with a task-based learning activity, which requires concrete action.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Developers love learning by experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="60f5" class="">Developers are hands-on learners and code is another language they speak. When they see code, they want to try it, break it apart, put it into action. It’s their favorite call-to-action, often when figuring out if an API is the right fit for them, developers would have already tested out the code samples on developer portals to make their choice.</p>
<p id="d54b" class="">This was proved by a&nbsp;<a href="https://eventil.com/talks/PPSznP-jarod-reyes-how-twilio-writes-documentation">user study</a>&nbsp;conducted by Twilio, where they found that pages with lesser words before code, did better than pages with more sentences before code.</p>

<p id="0a22">Before we further talk about code samples, it’s important to understand the need for them in the first place. Why can’t developers do without them?</p>
<p id="3347">And it all starts with putting an API call together. A lot goes into an API call, all these protocols, and conventions, and developers get all caught up in it, instead of focusing on their actual projects. It can take developers multiple hours to figure out what to put into a call, taking a toll on their productivity and creativity and all adding up to integration time.</p>
<p id="e3da" class="">What code samples do is put there calls together for them, in languages of their choice, so they don’t have to do it. Nicely done samples can get developers to&nbsp;<strong>the first Hello World</strong>&nbsp;with an API without writing a single line of code. Samples that go beyond that can be put straight into production. Which now leads to our next question.</p>
<h3 id="0d90">How many code samples can you write?</h3>
<p id="cae9">Not enough! Especially if you are looking for coverage of every endpoint. APIs tend to change and evolve and to update the samples manually with every iteration, even you somehow managed to produce them is not feasible.</p>
<p id="226a" class="">A viable approach here is to auto-generate these samples using an out of the box documentation solution. Different tools have different ideas on how to package deliver these samples. While some do the bare minimum, others go the extra mile to see developers have to put in as little work to get them running. It’s important for API owners to select the right tool to provide the best samples to their consumers, it should be a top priority choosing a documentation solution.</p>
<h2 id="db1d">Part II : Code Samples — Several Different Styles</h2>
<p id="3b6d" class="">To help API owners make well-informed choices, we ran a study to compare this different style of samples, which we analyzed keeping in mind the following qualities:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><strong>Learning Objective</strong>&nbsp;— They demonstrate actual (non-theoretical) use of API</li>
<li><strong>Runnable</strong>&nbsp;— Are runnable out of the box on a console and IDEs</li>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong>&nbsp;— Come with a playground to tweak them around</li>
<li><strong>Language Idiomatic —&nbsp;</strong>Proper language Structure to gel in with production-ready applications</li>
</ul>
<p id="d76f" class="">We categorized our learning into 5 different styles, the summary of which is categorized in the table below:</p>

Samples for some languages were copy-paste ready, while others took a bit of tweaking to run. In the case of Java, we had to configure maven dependencies for the build, and the generator could not pick some values such as the example body and the auth header, which have to be manually added.</p>

For instance, there is no body-serialization going on, all these different fields that have to go as arguments, go as one single string and there is no mechanism to put those values together in the form of one single string. These samples were found on Readme.io.</p>
<p id="7964" class="">What we also found missing in all three of these styles was lack of getting started guides, for instance, the HTTP client requires to be included as a dependency and then included as imports within the sample, something which has been left to the discretion of the user to figure out. For novice developers, setting up development environments may also prove to be a challenge, something which the samples or the documentation does not help with at all.</p>

<h2 id="21f7">Part III: Making Code Samples Work in Production</h2>
<p id="77cf" class="">Looking at the different styles of samples, the question that now arises is how practical are these samples to use? Do they completely replace the need to code, or are they just a push towards the right direction? Do they fully demonstrate the use case for the endpoint? Or do they just explain the logistics of making an API call?</p>
<h3 id="d87e">Language Coded HTTP Snippets or More?</h3>
<p id="6704">If you closely look at many of the auto-generated samples, especially the styles 1 to 4, what they essentially do is eliminate the redundant work of configuring environments, and help consumers figure out what kind of syntax to use. However, when making real-world use of API, you need a lot more. Do these samples, which essentially lack language structure and look like language translated HTTP requests, cut it? The answer is<strong>&nbsp;NO&nbsp;</strong>and for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><strong>No Data Types:</strong>&nbsp;The samples takes input and output in the form of a string, leaving it to the consuming developers to write an efficient i/o mechanism to complete these requests. Often the fields inside the body are not documented.</li>
<li><strong>No Data Models:</strong>&nbsp;Modelling the JSON/XML as classes make it easier to deal with the data, both input, and output. These “models” add a whole different layer on top of the API, with your application having to interact with the model, instead of queried response in JSON or XML.</li>
<li><strong>No Validation and Error Handling:</strong>&nbsp;Since there is no proper I/O mechanism, and both inputs are taken and output returns in form of JSON strings, it’s impossible to validate the sent data and handle error cases to determine what went wrong with the request.</li>
</ul>

<p id="e551" class="">Following which we wrote the code to take in input values for these attributes. Now that we ensured we took in these values, with their correct data types, how do we pass these in the request, since the request passes the arguments in the form of a string. Manually doing this was, of course, unfeasible and out of the question, so we had to write in an object to string mapper to do the job for us. This took in these various attribute fields and put them together in the form of a JSON string.</p>
<p id="b586" class="">It was at this point that we were able to achieve a business use case out of the sample. We could pass in the input parameters, with their correct types, concatenated as a JSON string and passed along with the argument. The model allowed us to keep local records of the sent values as well.https://blog.devapi.dream.press/media/a6a1ace16d322eaaf541f83acf4905f9</p>
<p id="4294" class="">Working with multiple endpoints and multiple models would have taken us even more time, depending on the use case and business logic. For instance, for the GET endpoints, we would have to write a string to object mapper to parse values from the response string back to our model. While the sample does a great job pushing developers in the right direction, it is clear that it is not a plug and play situation. Developers have to put in a lot of code to get the calls running, and have to figure out on their own what goes before or comes after the API call.</p>
<p><em>Now imagine if there were samples that could take care of all these logistics, you had to write no communication code at all, and could just plug and play a sample into action. The good news is, you no longer have to imagine. The language idiomatic samples generated alongside an SDK already do that for you.</em></p>
<h2 id="21e8">Language Idiomatic Code Samples — The Way To Go</h2>
<p id="b15b">SDKs have often been labeled as the cornerstone of the API developer experience. What SDKs essentially do is that they abstract out all underlying details of making an API call, making your API look like a library. They provide developers a complete framework to model their applications, including all the necessary dependencies, referenced libraries, system libraries, i/o mechanisms, and class models.</p>

<p id="4ce3" class="">Furthermore SDKs automatically format API responses to match the data types used in the programming language. They add an interface on top of the API, so your app interacts with the modeled data from SDK, instead of raw API arguments and responses. By providing SDKs, you can help developers focus on the business logic while taking care of API communication code.</p>
<p id="933e">Code samples generated with SDKs have a lot more work done on them. Since the SDK abstracts out request construction, none of the construction bit makes part of the sample, making the sample look very lean. Such samples can easily fit in with your applications in a very scalable manner, you only have to add minimal communication code, since there exist mechanisms to access, manipulate and work around with all the data fields, that go in and come out of an API call.</p>
<h2 class="has-text-align-center">. . .</h2>
<p id="308d" class="">Concluding this all, we strongly recommend that developers make use of code samples to consume APIs. No matter what style, design, or approach. Code samples will help you get started easily and save you tons of time. While for most people, the simple HTTP snippets may do the job, it is samples with more language structure that help with real-world use and can fit in straight with your applications.</p>
<p id="8467" class="">Again we emphasize the fact that the developer experience is a key driver for an API adoption. APIs are meant to execute integrations, and the easier to integrate, the better the API. Luckily for you, we at APIMatic hold all sorts of expertise to help improve the experience you deliver to developers.

<p id="c78a" class="">According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, there are over 39.6 million elderly people in the US, out of which 1 Million are being actively served an elderly care facility. Today’s seniors want to better leverage technology to enhance their quality of life. The industry, estimated at $740 billion, is full of challenges and is ready for disruption.</p>
<p id="c45a" class=""><a href="https://caremerge.com/">Caremerge</a>&nbsp;is one of the companies providing tools for modern elder care, including an API platform to drive apps and integrations. Partnering with APIMatic saved the Caremerge team lots of time and made it easy for others to build with their API.</p>
<p id="5757" class="">The company aims to provide an all in one platform to address all problems that challenge the demographic including Family Engagement, Community Engagement, Calendar Central, and Chronic Care Management. Additionally, they bring in various pre-existing services from the market and make them more accessible for these senior citizens, for instance with voice commands. Something which they manage using multiple internal microservices and a public API.</p>
<p id="9806" class="">Caremerge API powers much of the communication between the facilities and services they offer, and allows them to build integrations with various third-party vendors and services. Building those integrations requires the documentation for the API to be always upto the mark, meeting all modern standards, so developers spend less time figuring out how to integrate.</p>
<p id="364b" class="">But maintaining and producing documentation is a challenge of its own, something which took them valuable resource and time. Since the product is very technical, they had a senior engineer working on documentation. To save time for that resource they decided to automate documentation and started looking for an out of the box documentation solution. Trying multiple open source and paid solutions including Swagger UI, they found a lot of them hard to maintain. Until they came across APIMatic, which not only did the job for them by producing better than ever documentation, but did it in record saving time, while completely minimising the effort at their end.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“APIMatic helps us save 20–30% of the time it took us to manage documentation for our API”</p>
<cite>Fahad Aziz, Co-Founder and CTO, Caremerge</cite></blockquote>
<p id="d696" class="">Often documentation can get too wordy and hard to navigate, but according to Caremerge, their customers and partners loved the way information was laid out for them.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“ APIMatic has made integrating so easy for us. Whenever our partners go through the documentation, they know just what to do.”</p>
<cite>Muneeb Khawaja, VP Engineering, Caremerge</cite></blockquote>
<p id="f915" class="">What added wow factor to the documentation, was the interactive console, which allowed developers to test inputs and outputs, within the docs, allowing developers to back and forth with the API. Today CareMerge is working on more integrations that ever, helping seniors through out America live reasonably enhanced lives.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default">
<p>“Integrations built with APIMatic Documentation are benefitting over 30 thousand senior citizens ”</p>
<cite>Fahad Aziz, Co-Founder and CTO, Caremerge</cite></blockquote>
<p id="4050" class="">For us at APIMatic, it has always been a motto to make lives of developers easy, to make things comfortable for them, and those developers in turn contributing to enhance the quality of lives of our s<em>enior citizens,&nbsp;</em>is something which makes us really happy. Just like the medicare and healthcare industry, we are excited to see the senior living industry go through such a shift, and are delighted to be a part of it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p id="4cab" class="">The SMS industry is huge, and the bulk SMS industry huger. Wide adoption and availability of the technology has made it the number one choice of communication for businesses, who can now reach out to millions of people across the globe with the minimum of effort. Businesses today are making use of SMS messages to send alerts of all kinds, and for a very good reason.</p>
<blockquote class="">
<p id="d3ad" class="">SMS messages are more likely to be opened than Emails, a typical message is read within 3 minutes with a CTR of 19% versus 2% for email.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="b46e" class="">A lot of that is being done over (A2P), Application-to-Person, where an application is programmed to trigger messages at particular intervals or events. There are a number of tools available to run these campaigns, but none as customizable and powerful as SMS APIs which give direct control to businesses to build messaging facilities straight into their systems.</p>
<p id="9dc1" class="">As of now, they are more than&nbsp;<strong>750 Messaging APIs</strong>&nbsp;currently listed on Programmable Web, with more and more services being listed daily. Using SMS APIs, companies can send complex 2-Way SMS messages, marketing messages, verification messages, notifications, alerts and warnings of all kinds.</p>
<p id="0f97" class="">To see what makes some of these APIs so popular, we shortlisted a pool of them, analyzed what they had to offer, and what really makes them so popular in this age and time. The APIs that we analyzed include:</p>
<ul class="">
<li>Twilio</li>
<li>Nexmo</li>
<li>Plivo</li>
<li>Telstra</li>
<li>AT&amp;T</li>
<li>Bandwidth</li>
<li>ClickSend</li>
<li>MessageMedia</li>
</ul>
<p id="db07" class="">For the analysis, we started off by looking at the features these APIs have to offer, followed by the compliances they meet, and then their Developer Experience programs. By the end of the blog, you would know what does it take to stand out in the industry and compete with the giants we know today.</p>
<h2 id="9de9"><strong>Essential Features — SMS APIs 2019</strong></h2>
<p id="53af" class="">Analyzing these APIs in terms of the functionality they provide, we recognized that there are a set of features that are common to most of them. These features are the bare essentials if you want to make it in the SMS APIs space. They include:</p>

<p id="8d87" class="">Many of the APIs included in this study go beyond that and have added more value, building on these features. For instance Twilio allows sending of MMS messages, allowing senders to attached pictures or other forms of media. Furthermore, they have a mechanism to recognize the optimum routes to send out messages, ensuring guaranteed delivery in record time. Nexmo features a persistent sending ID, using the same number to send messages to one person. Plivo features number pooling, to distribute campaign loads and ensure quicker delivery.</p>
<h2 id="3099"><strong>Compliance Requirements — SMS APIs 2019</strong></h2>
<p id="8c9e" class="">For the telecommunication industry, one of the biggest challenges faced is being compliant with local and international regulations. Often continents, countries, states and even specific carrier networks, have a set of rules they abide with, and unless an SMS API caters to these rules, messages may never be delivered as intended and campaigns may go in vain.</p>
<p id="6064" class="">For most top SMS APIs, all these regulations are met and precautions are implemented, some important regulations and guides include:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><a href="https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/compliance/manual/8/viii-5.1.pdf">The TCPA (<em>Telephone Consumer Protection Act)</em></a></li>

<p id="ecc8" class="">And for that, we take you to the question,&nbsp;<strong>what makes a great API?</strong></p>
<p id="5e94" class="">And the unanimous answer to that is great&nbsp;<strong>Developer Experience.</strong>&nbsp;All the best APIs are easy to consume and require shorter development time to integrate.

<p id="4f3d">Where each of these API providers fills in quite a number of checks on the Developer Experience Checklist, each of them stood out in some respective fields.</p>
<p id="481b" class="">Twilio, Nexmo and ClickSend do a wonderful job with their Landing Pages, which do a great job onboarding users with what facilities they offer, what features does the API come with and how can they help them solve problems with tons of uses cases, tutorials, and Sample Apps. Almost all API Providers have made use of visuals and diagrams to explain the inner workings of an API.</p>
<p id="ef3a" class="">Bandwidth offers a Sandbox environment where users could play around with the API, similarly, MessageMedia offers an API console where Code Samples can be tried around with. Telstra has a run in postman button, where you can try out sample calls, the click of a button takes you to the postman tool.</p>
<p id="ec68">Both Twilio and Nexmo offer a dedicated API Service Status page, with intuitive layout structures that help consumers get to their desired bit of information faster.</p>
<p id="d7b9" class="">SDKs and Code Samples are also something that all these popular APIs have to offer, popular languages being: Ruby, PHP, Python, JavaScript, C# and Node.</p>
<h2 id="1752" class=""><strong>Great Developer Experience: A Challenge</strong></h2>
<p id="d64f" class="">If you are out at this making an SMS API, it’s essential that you miss out on none of these offerings, or you will stand no chance against the competition. Often smaller teams come up with brilliant technology but lack the numbers to focus on anything else except the core offering. It is just as essential to focus on material revolving around the API, the marketing pages, documentation, client libraries and much more, all of which take a lot of time, effort and energy, but without none of which your API will see success or adoption.</p>
<p id="54e5" class="">While companies like Twilio, Nexmo, and AT&amp;T can afford to heavily invest in programs like that, for startups and smaller companies it becomes impossible to spare time or money. With the cost and time it takes to produce all of this material, it’s not scalable with evolution, often Docs and SDKs lag far behind when APIs are multiple versions ahead, and this is the reason.</p>
<p id="4f0d" class="">So the challenge here is how do you take your brilliant API out to developers when you don’t have the means to keep it developer-friendly for long?</p>
<p id="050f" class="">And the answer lies in automation, while a human developer may take several days to produce and maintain all of these components, Code-Gen Engines can take an API Spec as input to automatically generate all of these components and all of it within a few minutes. Want to make updates to your API? Don’t worry, build the engine into your CI/CD pipeline and generate new components with every new push, release or update.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="">This blog is based on a talk presented at APIMatic’s <a href="https://youtu.be/hBDDc_qhnU4">meet-up&nbsp;&nbsp;in San Francisco</a> earlier in the year.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="fe62" class="">API specifications have become a crucial part of the API life cycle, acting as a gateway to better design, documentation and tooling for your API.</p>
<p id="5660" class="">Due to the growing popularity of API specifications, more and more organizations are moving towards spec-driven development. In this process, API are designed before built, so that any flaws and inconsistencies are recognized early on and fixed before the development. The approach ensures you stay on budget and avoid snags that can come from miscommunication.</p>
<p id="e125" class="">While a spec may ensure that there are no hiccups while developing APIs, the document itself is prone to inconsistencies and errors. Multiple stakeholders including developers, product owners, and technical writers contribute to the spec, and with all of them bringing in their own flavor and style, it often ends up looking like a mess.</p>
<p id="6a58" class="">Moreover, a spec is more than just a design artifact, it serves as a gateway to various API tooling throughout the API lifecycle. Many of the API Design, Management, Testing, Deployment, and Documentation tools today take API Specifications as input to work on the API, and unless free of flaws and contradictions, a spec can never be rendered in an efficient or effective manner.</p>
<p id="e314" class="">It’s therefore essential to have a set of guidelines to ensure the document remains free of conflicting styles and formats and is produced in one cohesive manner. This blog will cover a few of these guidelines and practices that you can follow to achieve consistency across the API Specification workflow while keeping it functional and agile.</p>
<h2 id="358a"><strong>1. Create a Style Guide</strong></h2>
<p id="8a35">Often organisations have a style guide for designers and writers to follow when producing branding content and material. In a similar fashion, all API teams should develop a style guide for writing API Specifications. And it should be enforced as a uniform practise throughout the organisation. The guide should recommend what sort of conventions and practices are to be used when contributing to the specification.</p>
<p id="e581" class="">For instance, often it’s unclear if:</p>
<ul class="">
<li>Schemas should have examples</li>
<li>In-line schemas are permissible</li>
<li>Operations must have descriptions</li>
<li>Parameters and responses restricted to certain types or numbers</li>
</ul>
<p id="8cdd" class="">Similarly, in many more cases like that, contributors whenever in doubt, just work with a style they are used to or comfortable with. The easy way out is to standardize these practices, and recommend a way which guides contributors from all departments to make additions in a uniform manner.</p>
<p id="35a2" class="">To ensure that the recommended practices are being followed, and no conflicts make through to the actual document, validators should be set up that verify if the addition is aligned with the recommended style. This can be executed with Linters, a popular linting tool for specs is “<a href="https://github.com/wework/speccy">Speccy</a>”, which takes your custom rules and runs the specs against it, validating it against those rules.</p>
<p id="c2bc" class="">Building validation into the CI/CD cycle further streamlines the process, so whenever updates are pushed to your API, they first go through these checks so that nothing of varying nature is added to your specification.</p>
<h2 id="4a8c"><strong>2. Promote Visibility and Reusability</strong></h2>
<p id="26b6" class="">Another common practice and really a nice one is to publish your API specs to Version Control for across board visibility. Make them available on a master repository and create a pull request mechanism, allowing nothing to pass to the central repository without a review, while still allowing contributors to view and make use of each and every contribution.</p>
<p id="9d76" class="">A big part of the specification is the schema itself, many organizations today are using JSON schema to define those specifications, even though OpenAPI has a schema that is subset of JSON schema, but JSON schema has very good tooling around it and in many more numbers. Defining models in JSON schema would make the spec very versatile and open-ended.</p>
<p id="892e" class="">You can again use Speccy to convert JSON schema to OAS schemas. This would allow you two things:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><strong>Keeping your schema separate from API specifications</strong></li>
</ul>
<p id="f7de">You have a new team and they want to use the same object the other team is using, from going to actually write it from hand again, and having discrepancies, you can use the same schema, just refer it in your spec.</p>
<ul class="">
<li><strong>Validating API specifications</strong></li>
</ul>
<p id="725f" class="">With JSON Schema Linting, you can write better tests. Resulting in better validation of schema.</p>
<p id="4ffb" class="">And for every artifact you are creating, schema or the spec, version them, so once your program scales, you know what version your API team is dependent on.</p>
<h2 id="5493"><strong>3. Separate API Design from Documentation</strong></h2>
<p id="f93c" class="">A specification is normally maintained by API developers, they are the people responsible for putting in what the requests are, what the endpoints are, how the responses would look like, basically the people turning an API into reality, but there is also a team of tech writers who work on the spec to add documentation, sample code, guides and tutorials, and all sort of help material to make sure that the API human-readable and usable.</p>
<p id="350e">To allow both the development and documentation team to work simultaneously, you can maintain documentation and tutorials as a separate project while the developers work on the spec to make changes to design</p>
<p id="6948" class="">There’s a concept of&nbsp;<strong>overlays</strong>, which has already been introduced in RAML and is still being talked about in OpenAPI Spec, and we here at APIMatic are actually building this out in our own format. What Overlays essential does is allow separation of these two concerns, letting your tech writers work independently so that any drastic change made to the specification does not affect them. The two can be merged later to make a comprehensive API reference.</p>
<h2 id="1af4" class=""><strong>4. Tag your Operations</strong></h2>
<p id="9fdc" class="">Another great practice is tagging your operations with groups and status and creating multiple versions of the same spec, for instance: Dev, Public, Partner, and Internal for different stakeholders. With this, a team can work on the same spec without creating multiple versions, and expose only the portions of that spec to the people they want it to be exposed. While exposing an Internal API, out of many hundreds of endpoints, choose the ones you want to make public while keeping the original spec as a single source of truth.</p>
<h2 id="8cbb" class=""><strong>5. Merge your API Specifications</strong></h2>
<p id="a227" class="">As your API team expands, you have multiple teams working on different services, the recommended practice is that specs for those services are maintained independently. Developers working on those services, as soon as they are done the building, update the spec and get it out. However, maintaining these services and specs separately does not mean they have to be exposed to the user in a similar fashion. Merging these different specs into a single unified one can provide the advantage of presenting a single view, single documentation, single library, and a single mock service.</p>
<p id="6a5c" class="">Few specification formats, especially the OpenAPI format is flexible enough to achieve this and anybody get a pipeline running by just writing a script. But the tool that we are working on at APIMatic will be able to merge any specification into a single one regardless of the format and the nature of it.</p>
<h2 id="8879" class=""><strong>6.</strong> Generate<strong> Changelogs</strong></h2>
<p id="b808" class="">This is another form of validation that you can achieve before making your specification public. Let’s say a developer comes in and makes an optional parameter, required. Now that would make things different for the user, and would not want this released without a version bump or release notes.</p>
<p id="bdb6" class=""><a href="https://github.com/Sayi/swagger-diff">Swaggerdiff</a>&nbsp;is a tool that can help you avoid that. Although it can work with just OpenAPI formats, for now, you can always make use of API Transformer to convert your spec to the format it supports and then run rests for your specifications to detect breaking and minor changes, which can be rendered in form of change-logs. A little work by your documentation team and they’d be good to go for your audiences as well.</p>
<h2 id="cee6" class="">What’s Next?</h2>
<p id="ca0a" class="">Now that you know what practices you need to follow to make sure the Spec is produced in a neat, clean and well-organized manner, it’s now time to consider the big question. What can you do with that spec, or why do you need such a well-rounded spec in the first place? Stay tuned for the next blog in line, which will discuss what can be done with a great-looking API specification.</p>

The series aims to highlight numerous ways in which developers can integrate&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.apimatic.io/transformer"><em>API Transformer</em></a><em> into their workflow in order to gain access to a wide range of tools and frameworks. Hopefully, it will help eliminate any assumptions that they have about being restricted to a particular set of tools just because they use a certain API specification format.&nbsp;</em></p>
<h2 id="8e77" class="">Announcing support for GraphQL Schema</h2>
<p id="4d39" class="">Oh yes, you heard it right. You can now&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/changelog/support-for-exporting-graphql-schema-files-now-available/">export GraphQL Schema from APIMatic</a>&nbsp;using&nbsp; API Transformer! Previously, we provided our users means of&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.apimatic.io/api-transformer-recipes-facilitating-migration-from-soap-to-rest-72b8248432d8">migrating from SOAP to REST</a>, and now also aim to facilitate those SOAP/REST users looking to migrate to GraphQL.</p>
<p id="c99b" class="">Why GraphQL, you wonder? Without going into details, GraphQL is known for being simpler, faster and efficient allowing users to fetch exactly the data they need. Many strongly believe that GraphQL is the future of APIs. So if you are one of them and are considering moving to GraphQL, read on.</p>
<p id="2a57" class="">Our support for GraphQL schema is currently in beta so we are open to any feedback/suggestions that you might have.</p>
<h2 id="512e" class="">Role of GraphQL Schema</h2>
<p id="7f3a" class="">GraphQL schemas for a service are defined using&nbsp;<a href="https://graphql.org/learn/schema/">GraphQL SDL</a>&nbsp;(schema definition language) having a pretty simple syntax for defining various components like types, queries, mutations etc. We’ll take a look at some examples later in this blog.</p>
<p id="50c9">A GraphQL schema is at the core of any GraphQL server implementation. It describes the functionality available to the client applications that connect to it. So having this schema file will serve as a key starting point for migrating your API to GraphQL. You can then easily generate server code, resolver signatures, etc. from it using various tools available out there.</p>
<h2 id="109f">Export GraphQL Schema Files with API Transformer</h2>
<p id="d41a" class="">Bring your API files and export them to GraphQL schema using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apimatic.io/transformer">API Transformer</a>. All major input formats (e.g. OpenAPI, RAML, API Blueprint, etc.) are supported.</p>
<p id="5919">The following features of the schema are supported:</p>
<ul class="">
<li>Object types</li>
<li>Scalar and Enumeration types</li>
<li>Input types</li>
<li>Arguments</li>
<li>Queries</li>
<li>Mutations</li>
<li>Lists and Non-null fields</li>
</ul>
<p id="8a1e" class="">GraphQL itself does not impose any strict naming conventions other than a list of allowed characters mentioned in their&nbsp;<a href="https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Names">spec</a>. However, keeping in mind some of the best practices highlighted for&nbsp;<a href="https://graphqlmastery.com/blog/graphql-best-practices-for-graphql-schema-design">GraphQL schema design</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.apollographql.com/designing-graphql-mutations-e09de826ed97">mutations</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://graphqlmastery.com/blog/how-to-use-graphql-enum-type-and-its-best-practices">GraphQL enum types</a>, we follow some conventions to make the migration process for our users easier. These conventions aim to facilitate development and interoperability.</p>
<p id="2c5f"><strong>Conventions</strong></p>
<ul class="">
<li>The names of various components will obey the rules specified in the spec.</li>
<li>Object/Input and Enumeration type names will be&nbsp;<code>pascal</code>&nbsp;cased.</li>
<li>All field names will be&nbsp;<code>camel</code>&nbsp;cased.</li>
<li>Enumeration field names will be&nbsp;<code>upper</code>&nbsp;cased to represent their nature as constants.</li>
<li>HTTP verb will be prepended with query/mutation names to represent the action that will be performed upon calling it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2593">For SOAP Users — Migrating to GraphQL</h2>
<p id="04e6" class="">With&nbsp; API Transformer, SOAP users can start migrating to GraphQL by obtaining a GraphQL schema file from their service WSDL file. This involves a conversion of all WSDL types to GraphQL schema types, operations to mutations and attributes to arguments. The example below illustrates this:</p>
<p id="7774" class="">WSDL example:</p>
<pre class=""><code class="language-xml">&lt;definitions name=&quot;HelloService&quot; targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.examples.com/wsdl/HelloService.wsdl&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/&quot; xmlns:soap=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/&quot; xmlns:tns=&quot;http://www.examples.com/wsdl/HelloService.wsdl&quot; xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; xmlns:s=&quot;http://www.examples.com/schema1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;types&gt;
      &lt;schema xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.examples.com/schema1&quot; elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&gt;
        &lt;element name=&quot;GreetingMessage&quot;&gt;
            &lt;complexType&gt;
                &lt;sequence&gt;
                    &lt;element name=&quot;senderName&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;element name=&quot;greeting&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;/sequence&gt;                
            &lt;/complexType&gt;
        &lt;/element&gt;
      &lt;/schema&gt;
  &lt;/types&gt;
  &lt;message name=&quot;SendMessageRequest&quot;&gt;
      &lt;part name=&quot;message&quot; type=&quot;s:GreetingMessage&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/message&gt;
  &lt;message name=&quot;SendMessageResponse&quot;&gt;
      &lt;part name=&quot;message&quot; type=&quot;s:GreetingMessage&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/message&gt;
  &lt;portType name=&quot;Hello_PortType&quot;&gt;
      &lt;operation name=&quot;sendMessage&quot;&gt;
         &lt;input message=&quot;tns:SendMessageRequest&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;output message=&quot;tns:SendMessageResponse&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/operation&gt;
  &lt;/portType&gt;
  &lt;binding name=&quot;Hello_Binding&quot; type=&quot;tns:Hello_PortType&quot;&gt;
      &lt;soap:binding style=&quot;rpc&quot;
         transport=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;operation name=&quot;sendMessage&quot;&gt;
         &lt;soap:operation soapAction=&quot;sendMessage&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;input&gt;
            &lt;soap:body encodingStyle=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;
               namespace=&quot;urn:examples:helloservice&quot;
               use=&quot;encoded&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/input&gt;    
         &lt;output&gt;
            &lt;soap:body encodingStyle=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;

<h2 id="8674">For REST Users — Layering GraphQL on top</h2>
<p id="91f0" class="">Instead of completely migrating to GraphQL, users generally prefer to add a GraphQL layer on top of REST and enjoy benefits of both. The choice is yours depending on your service and system needs.</p>
<p id="841a" class="">You can convert your RESTful API defined in one of the popular formats like OpenAPI/Swagger, RAML, etc. to GraphQL schema with&nbsp; API Transformer. The conversion process will:</p>
<ul class="">
<li>Convert GET operations to GraphQL queries while other operations involving server-side changes to GraphQL mutations.</li>
<li>Convert complex types in the API to GraphQL object and enumeration types.</li>
<li>Wrap operation parameters in a GraphQL input type and link that input type to respective query/mutation arguments.</li>
</ul>

<p id="381f" class="">Documentation for APIs starts with Change Logs and Version release notes. We believe that is a really important practice, early on educating users, what preliminary actions they have to take before going on with implementation are really important. We love how they set out the context, and answer any sort of considerations such as security concerns, terminology, rate limiting and all other queries a user may have before they actually get to documentation.</p>
<p id="7c35">The Reference docs are beautiful, come with a detailed description of parameters, sample call request, and responses and an API Console where those calls can be tried out and tested.</p>

<p id="57ac" class="">On the Landing Page, they send out a very bold message about their mission, and with that list their APIs, customer stories, use cases and talk about open banking overall. Building upon the value of their offering is something that all API providers have done in this space and we cannot stress how important that is considering the competition in this fast-paced industry.</p>

<p id="a8dd">Coming from an industry that is still emerging, it’s impressive how they check most of the things from the Developer Experience checklist. And their wide adoption should come as no surprise.</p>
<p id="c17a">Summarizing the research we found out, although most of these APIs offer a number of components from the Developer Experience checklist, it’s FinTech APIs that has taken the lead by offering SDKs and investing more in thier documentation practises. A developer coming in for a payment solution is more likely going to choose an API, which has an implementation available in a language they are comfortable with and is more convenient to use, hence no wonder Stripe and Square are global leaders today.</p>
<p id="889f" class="">If you are in the Finance industry, you too can offer an amazing developer experience for your API, and without putting in the hard work, time or dedicating resources. We can help you get started with your developer experience program from the Landing Pages, to Docs, Code Samples, SDKs, and everything.&nbsp;</p>
