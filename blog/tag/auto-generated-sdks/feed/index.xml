<p class=""><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1816 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Integrate-Java-SDKs-into-Android-02-1024x498.png" alt="" width="729" height="355"></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your mobile/Android application can talk to any API with the low-code approach through client SDKs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Client SDKs are independent internal libraries for your application that focus on the end-to-end flow for an API.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They cut down the manual process of writing a whole client and related components, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">providing you with the best developer experience, and increasing API adoption</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You just have to import an auto-generated end-to-end SDK and focus on the core business logic in your application.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://apimatic.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">APIMatic</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a developer experience platform that provides automatic code generation for API specifications, in multiple popular languages. In this blog, we will be discussing how to integrate Java SDKs into Android applications.</span></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Java Libraries Instead of Android Native Libraries?</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">An AAR (i.e. Android ARchive) file can be included in the build process of an Android application similar to a JAR (i.e. Java ARchive) file. Both can serve the same purpose but the main difference between a JAR and an AAR is that AARs can include resources such as layouts, drawables, and more.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">For an API client SDK, you don&#8217;t need Android components and resources, but some classes, making the library lightweight that developers can quickly interact with to call your APIs, making a JAR library a better option than AAR.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another advantage of using Java libraries is that JAR can be used for IDEs like eclipse and Android Studio without any complicated steps. Also, JAR, in contrast to AAR, can be used with any Java application which makes it technology-independent in terms of Java-specific applications like web, desktop, and Android apps.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the Java SDK</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">APIMatic SDKs adhere to the best </span><a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/sdk-coding-standards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coding practices and standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;and support the latest dependencies and versions for full coverage. The Java SDK uses Maven as its project management tool which allows it to adjust itself in the Maven ecosystem.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an Android application, the Gradle build system makes it easier to include external binaries and other library modules to your build as dependencies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These dependencies can be located on your machine or in a remote repository, and any transitive dependencies declared are automatically included as well.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having Gradle support of adding Maven dependencies directly makes it easier for developers to include Maven projects like an APIMatic SDK as a dependency. This enables you to consume Maven libraries for any application built on top of Java or Kotlin languages. APIMatic Java SDKs have this ability and allow you to accomplish what you need with some clicks.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this blog, we will use our public </span><a href="https://github.com/apimatic/calculator-sdk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculator SDK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an example to demonstrate how to integrate Java SDKs into Android applications. The Calculator SDK contains simple operations like addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, and a README file that walks you through the setup installation and highlights the documentation of the modules involved.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The published Java SDK has the following Maven identifiers:</span></p>
<pre class=""><code class="language-xml">Group-id: io.github.apimatic
Artifact-id: sample-calculator-sdk
Version: 1.0.0
</code></pre>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Integrate Java SDKs into Android Applications?</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two ways to integrate Java SDKs into Android applications:</span></p>
<ul class="">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Declare the dependency directly using groupId, artifact, and version</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilize the GUI tool provided by Android Studio</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The source of the artifact could be one of the following:</span></p>
<ul class="">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Remote Artifact (Gradle will resolve the artifact from Maven central repository)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Local Artifact (Gradle will resolve the artifact from the local Maven repository)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Import Remote Dependency</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: A prerequisite to import the remote dependency is that the Java SDK should already be published on the Maven repository. In our case, the calculator SDK is published on Maven Central under the group id </span><a href="https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.github.apimatic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">io.github.apimatic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Option 1: Add Dependency Using Android Studio</span></h3>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow these steps to include the dependency:</span></p>
<ol class="">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Android project structure, select </span><b>Dependencies </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the left navigation section. Select the target module and click on </span><b>Library Dependency </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">as shown: <img class=" wp-image-1806 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image3.png" alt="" width="657" height="344"></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the subsequent dialog box, search for the group id </span><b>io.github.apimatic</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Configure your dependency if required (labeled 2) and click </span><b>OK</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.<img class=" wp-image-1804 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image1.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="470"></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the last step, click on </span><b>Apply</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>OK</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Gradle will start syncing.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Option 2: Adding the Dependency Directly&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also add the dependency directly in the respective module’s </span><b>build.gradle</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> file. This can be achieved by setting a lookup configuration for Maven Central in Dependency Resolution Management through the root level build file, i.e. build.gradle, shown below:</span></p>
<pre class=""><code class="language-xml">buildscript {
    ...
    repositories {
        ...
        MavenCentral()
        ...
    }
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add the artifact information like </span><b>groupId</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>artifactId</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><b>version </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the </span><b>dependencies </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">section of the respective module, for example:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<pre class=""><code class="language-xml">dependencies {
    ...
    implementation &#039;io.github.apimatic:sample-calculator-sdk:1.0.0&#039;
    ...
}</code></pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow the proper format for Maven Central as prescribed in </span><a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gradle official documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Read more on </span><a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/single_versions.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gradle Version Ranging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Import Local Dependency</span></h3>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gradle can consume dependencies available in the local Maven repository (i.e. in-home directory under </span><b>.m2</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directory). The target artifact should already exist in the local Maven repository. In order to achieve this, use the following Maven build command to build the project and have a snapshot in the local repository:</span></p>
<pre class=""><code class="language-bash">mvn clean install
</code></pre>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will make the artifact locally available. Now, it can be added as a dependency or external JAR.</span></p>
<h3 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Option 1: Add Dependency as External JAR</span></h3>
<ol class="">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locate the JAR file in the system. Copy and paste the SDK JAR file in </span><b>libs </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">directory of your application.<img class="size-full wp-image-1807 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image4.png" alt="" width="595" height="417"></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now right click on the copied JAR file and click </span><b>Add As Library.<img class=" wp-image-1805 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image2.png" alt="" width="598" height="592"></b></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once added, a popup will appear to confirm the target module, select the module and click </span><b>OK</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.<img class=" wp-image-1808 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image5.png" alt="" width="398" height="116"></span></li>
</ol>
<h3 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Option 2: Add Dependency Directly</span></h3>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow Gradle to search in the local Maven repository by adding </span><b>mavenLocal()</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> configuration in the </span><b>settings.gradle</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> file (i.e. project/root level Gradle settings).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<pre class=""><code class="language-xml">buildscript {
    ...
    repositories {
        ...
        mavenLocal()
        ...
    }
    ...
}</code></pre>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add the dependency in </span><b>build.gradle</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (i.e. module-level Gradle settings) as shown:</span></p>
<pre class=""><code class="language-xml">dependencies {
    ...
    implementation &#039;io.github.apimatic:sample-calculator-sdk:1.0.0&#039;
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dependency format is in the form of &lt;</span><b>groupId:artifactId:version&gt;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but it can be applied through different formats as prescribed on </span><a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gradle official documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Gradle also supports version ranging.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Gradle is synchronized, the application is ready to consume the added SDK dependency.</span></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the Imported SDK in Java and Kotlin</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the dependency resolution is done, you can start using the SDK components in your application.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java Code Sample</span></h3>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following code sample in Java shows how easily you can initialize the client and use the Multiply endpoint of the integrated Calculator SDK in the Android application:</span></p>
<pre class=""><code class="language-java">// client initialization in Java

APIMATICCalculatorClient client = new APIMATICCalculatorClient.Builder()
    .httpClientConfig(configBuilder -&gt; configBuilder
            .timeout(0))
    .environment(Environment.PRODUCTION)
    .build();

</code></pre>
<pre class=""><code class="language-java">// Preparing and Calling API Endpoint

GetCalculateInput getCalculateInput = new GetCalculateInput();
getCalculateInput.setOperation(OperationTypeEnum.MULTIPLY);
getCalculateInput.setX(222.14);
getCalculateInput.setY(165.14);

client.getSimpleCalculatorController()
        .getCalculateAsync(getCalculateInput)
            .thenAccept(result -&gt; {
                // TODO success callback handler
            }).exceptionally(exception -&gt; {
                // TODO failure callback handler
                return null;
            });

</code></pre>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kotlin Code Sample</span></h3>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following code sample in Kotlin shows how easy it is to initialize the client and use the Multiply endpoint of the integrated Calculator SDK in your Android application:</span></p>
<pre class=""><code class="language-kotlin">// client initialization in Kotlin

var client: APIMATICCalculatorClient = APIMATICCalculatorClient.Builder()
    .httpClientConfig { configBuilder: HttpClientConfiguration.Builder -&gt;
        configBuilder
            .timeout(0)
    }
    .environment(Environment.PRODUCTION)
    .build()

</code></pre>
<pre class=""><code class="language-kotlin">// Preparing and Calling API Endpoint

val getCalculateInput = GetCalculateInput()
getCalculateInput.operation = OperationTypeEnum.MULTIPLY
getCalculateInput.x = 222.14
getCalculateInput.y = 165.14

client.simpleCalculatorController.getCalculateAsync(getCalculateInput)
   .thenAccept { result -&gt;
       // TODO success callback handler
   }
   .exceptionally {
       // TODO failure callback handler
       null
   }</code></pre>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">APIMatic Java SDKs are fully compliant with the Android app environment making app development quicker. With APIMatic, you can focus on the business domain and leave the server or third-party communication to APIMatic SDKs.

<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The API community seems to have settled upon one ground rule: give the developers what they want, and then some more. Yay for the external developers (the API users), nay for the internal developers (the API developers).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exponential growth in APIs and the consequent competition between the API providers warrant the need for maximum developer experience with the least onboarding problems.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automated SDK and API documentation generations are a sure way to boost API adoption while lifting the strain of repetitive tasks off developers. API provider companies from various industries like communication, fintech, and travel enjoy better team productivity and faster time to market as the time-consuming monotony of maintaining SDKs and API documentation is handled by APIMatic.</span></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication APIs: Increased Developer Productivity for MessageMedia</span></h2>
<p class=""><a href="https://messagemedia.com/us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MessageMedia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is Australia’s leading global business messaging platform that offers communication services between its customers’ workforce.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending over a billion messages per year and servicing thousands of global customers required a streamlined developer experience to integrate their various messaging APIs, and manually updating SDKs on each update was not optimal.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the problems we had with our SDKs was if a new feature was added to the API, we would have to manually make the code changes to the SDKs itself. Given we have 6 SDKs for each of our APIs, it was a long and inefficient process to update.” — Ibrahim Tareq, Developer Evangelist</span></i></span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">With APIMatic’s CodeGen Engine, MessageMedia was able to auto-generate SDKs in all of the required languages, and the SDKs could reflect changes in the API on the go, which had been a pain point for the team.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It has helped reduce the barrier of entry… you can hand out SDKs to your customers and make it easier and simpler for them to code their way to the first ‘hello world’.”</span></i></span></p>
<p class="">Case Study: <a href="https://blog.apimatic.io/messagemedia-speaking-the-language-of-developers-with-apimatic-codegen-5a3a7ad17d8e"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MessageMedia Increases Developer Productivity with Autogenerated SDKs</span></a></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech APIs: Revenue Generator for Fortune 500 Fintech</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leading financial services giant provides access to the world’s largest independent payment network to almost any country in the world through API integrations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, this company was quick to realize that in order to obtain partnerships and integrations with third parties, they needed to reach out to a larger developer community and ensure that their APIs were adopted faster. They began offering .NET and Java SDKs for their APIs, which were built in-house, but maintaining them took the time that could instead be spent on expanding their API landscape with the growing demand.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Writing SDKs for just two languages was a pretty time consuming and expensive </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">process, every time we had a release that affected those services, it would increase </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">our sprints and dev timelines” &#8211; Head of Innovation</span></i></span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">APIMatic’s CodeGen Engine streamlined their process in the form of automatically generated SDKs and API documentation for six languages instead of two, directly from their API definition files. This resulted in cost savings of hundreds of thousands of dollars compared to building SDKs and docs in-house while reducing their time to market the APIs.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fast go-to-market time for documentation, and then the ability to generate SDKs in </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple languages; those were the things that attracted us to APIMatic.”</span></i></span></p>

<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operation Management APIs: From 1 Week to 18 Seconds with Dude Solutions</span></h2>
<p class=""><a href="https://www.dudesolutions.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dude Solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a leading software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider of operations management solutions for education, government, healthcare, and many industries.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have two front-facing REST APIs that drive their platform and are supported by a set of micro-services that specialize in different areas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dude Solutions realized early on that with SDKs, they would have sharable software that could be used across the entire platform. It would reduce the amount of code in each API stack and understand the security protocols. However, they started by creating the SDKs from scratch and soon enough found out that it was just as long a process as API development.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We learned that it takes almost as long to do the API implementation as it did the SDK development. In fact, it took one week to develop the SDK for a single language.” &#8211; Brian Hyder, Engineering Manager</span></i></span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they began designing their next micro-service, Dude Solutions started looking for alternate ways for SDK development and came across APIMatic. The autogeneration of SDKs in multiple languages helped drastically cut down SDK development and maintenance costs.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Development time for SDKs for each language went from 1 week to 18 seconds thanks to APIMatic.”</span></i></span></p>

<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel APIs: Client Onboarding Time Reduced by 20% for Didgigo</span></h2>
<p class=""><a href="https://www.didgigo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didgigo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a digital media platform that assists travel agents in organizing and maintaining data, as well as creating detailed itinerary proposals that save time and boost sales opportunities for clients.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didgigo offers APIs that allow travel experts to create travel documents for their clients automatically and publish both digital and print versions at the same time. However, for a firm that excels at offering automated tailor-made solutions to its clients, it became critical to find a solution that could shorten the API onboarding time for customers, without the engineering team having to context switch on each release.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our process was extremely manual and required a lot of back and forth” &#8211; Keanu Ashwell, Development Operations Engineer</span></i></span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">With APIMatic’s autogenerated documentation in multiple languages, Didgigo is able to shift its focus on building robust APIs, without having to devote time and resources to maintain the documentation. The customer onboarding process has become more streamlined, with tickets raised during onboarding being <strong>reduced by 11-20%</strong>, and customer onboarding meetings going down by more than 7 meetings per quarter.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our experience with APIMatic and its provisions has been exceptional. We haven&#8217;t had </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">much time to maintain everything as we&#8217;re still strapped for resources due to COVID-19, </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">but we&#8217;ve still been able to rely on APIMatic to give our API users an understanding of </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what functionality we expose via our APIs. The ability to test [the APIs] is also a feature I </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">love and something that drew me to the service when we migrated from our in-house Swagger solution.”</span></i></span></p>

<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare/Senior Living APIs: Time to Release Down by 30% for Caremerge</span></h2>
<p class=""><a href="https://caremerge.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caremerge</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all-in-one platform that empowers families, residents, and staff of senior citizens by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">providing tools for modern elder care including family engagement, community engagement, chronic care management, and more.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caremerge also uses various pre-existing services to make them more accessible for these senior citizens, for example with voice commands. However, managing all these services in a single platform requires multiple internal microservices and a public API.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Caremerge API powers communication between the services they offer and allows them to build integrations with various third-party vendors and services. Building those integrations requires the documentation for the API to be always updated, so developers spend less time figuring out how to integrate.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using APIMatic’s autogenerated API documentation with the API playground allows developers to test inputs and outputs within the docs, resulting in quicker integration of the API, and helps Caremerge cut down on time spent on maintenance.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“APIMatic helps us save 20–30% of the time it took us to manage documentation for our API” &#8211; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fahad Aziz, Co-Founder, and CTO</span></em></span></p>

<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">How can you reduce client onboarding of your API so that the API user quickly gets to their first &#8220;Hello World&#8221;?</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">One definitive way is to provide an SDK for a developer&#8217;s technology stack so that they can easily integrate your APIs onto their native platforms.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> By providing an SDK, it becomes much simpler for a developer to integrate your API in ways that are familiar and well-integrated with their existing toolchain</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">In simpler terms, it is no longer enough to expose your API endpoints with just HTTP documentation or API references. You need to attract developers to enable them to comfortably play around with your code, and this is what APIMatic SDKs help with.</span></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">APIMatic as a Code Generator</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://www.apimatic.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">APIMatic</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> autogenerates SDKs </span><span style="font-weight: 400">f</span><span style="font-weight: 400">or APIs automatically in all major programming languages so that developers can consume APIs in their favorite development environment with less code, less effort, and more fun</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">These </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/overview-sdks/"><span style="font-weight: 400">comprehensive SDKs</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> help accelerate the API consumption process as they can be automatically generated and shipped along with your latest API update. They accurately map your API definition files into their respective classes and controllers while adhering to the best coding practices. APIMatic further provides flexibility to customize code generation through </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/configure-codegen/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Customizable CodeGen Settings</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. APIMatic generates SDKs in the following languages:</span></p>
<ul class="">
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">PHP</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ruby</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Python</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">C# (.NET)</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">TypeScript</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Building and maintaining these feature-packed SDKs from scratch is not easy and requires extensive engineering time and effort. However, autogenerated SDKs can significantly cut down costs and time.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">For more detailed pros and cons of manually generating SDKs against autogenerating them, read here on </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://www.apimatic.io/blog/2021/09/the-great-sdk-battle-build-vs-buy/"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Great SDK Battle: Build vs Buy</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">How does APIMatic Autogenerate SDKs?</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">SDK generation is a tricky challenge for API providers. On one side, you want to keep SDKs with minimal code and dependencies and on the other hand, you want to customize the generated code according to the needs of the developers. APIMatic gives you an easy solution by providing autogenerated SDKs for your APIs.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">APIMatic’s Code Generation Engine follows several steps internally to generate client libraries from API definition files. The code generation process starts with an input API definition file which can be in any of the multiple supported </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://www.apimatic.io/transformer/#supported-formats"><span style="font-weight: 400">API definition formats</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> like OpenAPI, RAML, API Blueprint, etc.</span></p>
<ul class="">
<li><b>API Transformation: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">This step transforms the input API definition file into APIMatic&#8217;s format which contains useful information for SDK generation that is not available in other API definition formats.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>API Validation:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400">After an input file is transformed into APIMatic’s format, it is validated. The validation process includes checking for syntactical and semantical discrepancies in the API definition and shows critical warnings and errors to be fixed before SDK generation can proceed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>SDK Generation: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, components of the API definition are looped over to generate code representations. While a basic SDK caters to settings, endpoints, and an abstraction layer, APIMatic goes an extra step by mapping your API completely into an SDK</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Some important entity conversions from an API definition to an SDK are:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Settings -&gt; Configuration files:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> All API settings like environment configuration etc are consolidated in a configuration file.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Endpoints -&gt; Functions:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Each endpoint maps onto an independent function.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Groups -&gt; Controller class files:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Endpoints are automatically grouped into separate Controller classes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Models -&gt; Model class files:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Data input is converted into models.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Errors -&gt; Exception class files:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Errors are handled as exceptions via a unified exception class.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp; &nbsp; Apart from these core files, the CodeGen engine also generates the following utility files:</span></p>
<ul class="">
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul class="">
<li style="font-weight: 400;text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;HTTP abstraction layer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;Helper class files</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Client library interface</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Language/platform-dependent files</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Documentation Generation: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Every generated SDK also includes a README.md file. The README contains complete class reference and code samples for the SDK and guides the user on setting up the environment (using tool-specific IDEs), initializing the client, creating the controller, calling the endpoints, and testing them.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Packaging:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400">After all the SDK files have been generated, there are multiple packaging options available to APIMatic users. You can either get the SDK packaged in a zip file, have it deployed to GitHub, or </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/publishing-a-package/"><span style="font-weight: 400">publish it as a package</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> on platforms like npm, NuGet, RubyGems, and PyPI.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">For more detail on the mapping from an API specification file to SDK, please refer to the </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/overview-sdks/"><span style="font-weight: 400">APIMatic SDK O</span>verview</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Features Supported in APIMatic&#8217;s Autogenerated SDKs&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">APIMatic SDKs supports the latest versions and language dependencies, along with features that make them as robust and fault-tolerant as possible.</span></p>
<p class=""><strong>Immutable Clients for Multi-Threading</strong></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">An</span><a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/changelog/apimatic-code-generator-v3-titan#new-immutable-clients-in-sdks"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Immutable Client</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> does not allow the user of the client to mutate the client (i.e change its state) once it has been created.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Client classes of all the SDKs are designed using the immutable design pattern. This gives developers the assurity that no method call would mutate its state once the client is instantiated.</span></p>
<p class=""><strong>Timeout and Retries on API Call Errors</strong></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">APIMatic generated SDKs help you write fault-tolerant applications by helping deal with network fault errors. If an API call fails due to network problems, it is retried with an exponentially increasing wait time up to a maximum retry count specified by the user. This is particularly helpful during temporary network outages.</span></p>
<p class=""><strong>Support for XML in API Calls</strong></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">The SDKs contain support for </span><a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/changelog/apimatic-code-generator-v3-titan#support-for-xml"><span style="font-weight: 400">sending and receiving XML</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the API calls, alongside JSON. So if your API definition uses XML, it can be imported into APIMatic to generate SDKs without having to worry about serializing and deserializing the XML data.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""><strong>oneOf and anyOf Support</strong></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Java, Python, and PHP SDKs contain the support of <strong>oneOf</strong> and <strong>anyOf</strong> which gives the ability to create a complex schema or validate a value against multiple criteria.</span></p>
<p class=""><strong>Support for Nullable Properties in Models</strong></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">J</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ava and C# SDKs contain nullable properties in models, so if a user does not assign any value to a property after model instance initialization, a null value will be sent in the HTTP request instead of being skipped altogether.</span></p>
<p class=""><strong>Access to HTTP Response Data</strong></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">The SDKs also allow access to the HTTP response information like response headers, status code, and body on API calls. </span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400">Other features in the SDKs include optimized error messages, handling cancellation of API calls, and more. For more information and details on all the features that APIMatic SDKs provide, have a look at our </span><span style="color: #3366ff"><a style="color: #3366ff" href="https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/sdk-features/"><span style="font-weight: 400">SDK Features List</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s it like to call your API? Developers want to use your API to accomplish something, and you want to make it as easy as possible for them to incorporate your service. To allow developers to call your API directly from any technology, your docs provide DIY instructions. To go a step further and give developers additional conveniences and tooling, you can provide Software Development Kits (SDKs). SDKs include code to call your API so that developers don&#8217;t have to write it themselves from scratch.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">While calling an API directly vs. using an SDK does not change the ultimate functionality of the API, it can dramatically affect the developer experience. In most cases, one method will be preferred over the other, varying according to each developer’s needs, preferences, and skills. An SDK offers simplicity and speedier development but applies only to a particular development framework. SDKs require resources to develop and maintain. Direct calls offer platform flexibility and are available to all developers, but are harder to use without expertise.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we&#8217;ll be looking at why your developer experience may focus on direct API calls, SDKs, or both.</span></p>

<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct API Calls: The Basics</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For communicating with a service, sending API calls directly to URL endpoints is the simplest way. Of course, when we say </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">simplest</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we mean in terms of program complexity, not ease of use.</span>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">When using an API without an SDK, you make calls to its URL endpoints directly using standard internet protocol commands for transferring packets of information over the network. There&#8217;s no abstraction between you and the service, so every parameter must be written into the call. It must also conform to a standard format.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of how to construct a direct API call using Python is shown in the code snippet below. Notice the URL for the API endpoint is specified explicitly, alongside required header parameters that describe the request. This information is bundled and transmitted using the <code>requests</code> library, which then receives any response data returned by the API and stores it in the <code>resp</code> variable. Note that the cost of deserialization is added here for the API call.</span></p>

<pre class=""><code class="language-python">import requests
from requests.structures import CaseInsensitiveDict

url = &quot;https://connect.squareup.com/v2/payments&quot;

headers = CaseInsensitiveDict()
headers[&quot;Square-Version&quot;] = &quot;2021-06-16&quot;
headers[&quot;Authorization&quot;] = &quot;Bearer ACCESS TOKEN&quot;
headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;application/json&quot;

resp = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
print(resp.status_code)

decoded = jsonpickle.decode(resp.text)
</code></pre>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another example of a non-trivial API call can be seen here, pulled from the User Authentication documentation for the</span> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dropbox API</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>


<figure id="attachment_1520" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1520" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1520 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dropbox-1024x677.png" alt="dropbox user authentication" width="790" height="523"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1520" class="wp-caption-text">Dropbox User Authentication Docs</figcaption></figure>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For many developers, the need to specify every parameter is exactly what they want: the full power of the service at their fingertips.</span>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-level control can be unnecessary and overwhelming, though, especially for new developers. With just the basic building blocks, it can become a challenge for developers to perform more complicated tasks.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only can direct API calls be complicated to do correctly, but they can also be frustrating to try to troubleshoot. API response codes aren&#8217;t particularly specific when providing error messages; Many developers may give up after countless generic 404 errors.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, many developers will wish they could have something a little more prepared for them. For those developers, you can please them by offering SDKs in their language.</span></p>

<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDKs: What Are They?</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDKs are a compilation of environment-specific developer tools designed to access your API. SDKs make it more straightforward for developers to use your API using a programming language framework they prefer. For the developer who wants a little more guidance, SDKs will be the most appealing way for them to access your service.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDKs abstract away the minutiae of the API that often bog down implementation for developers. They can be thought of as an API wrapper that makes accessing that API more friendly to a particular type of developer. A developer has to download and install an SDK that matches the language of their development environment, where it will then provide a host of streamlined functionalities for interacting with your API. If the developer is using Python, for instance, they’ll most likely download an SDK through pip, such as this example from </span><a href="https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/quick-start/tutorials/quick-start-with-the-api-client/python/?client=python"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Algolia’s documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>


<figure id="attachment_1521" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1521" style="width: 721px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1521 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/algolia-1024x350.png" alt="Algolia Documentation" width="721" height="247"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1521" class="wp-caption-text">Algolia SDK download through pip</figcaption></figure>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The example call to Dropbox&#8217;s API, shown earlier, constructed with their Python SDK is shown below. In contrast to a direct API call, it does not require the developer to hard code a URL and headers. Instead, the API token is passed to a provided client object that handles those details.</span></p>

<pre class=""><code class="language-python">import dropbox
token = &#039;My-API-Token&#039;
dbx = dropbox.Dropbox(token)

My_Field = dropbox.file_properties.PropertyField(&#039;Security Policy&#039;,&#039;Confidential&#039;)
My_Template_ID = &#039;ptid:1...&#039;
My_Property_Group = dropbox.file_properties.PropertyGroup(template_id=My_Template_ID, fields=[My_Field])

dbx.file_properties_properties_add(&quot;/my_awesome/word.docx&quot;, My_Property_Group)
</code></pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While APIs aren&#8217;t language-specific, SDKs are. A developer will download the SDK for the specific language they want to work with. API providers that intend to offer SDKs have to research what languages most appeal to their core user base. Developers who have the use of an SDK will be incredibly satisfied by the bevy of tools made available for them, including, but not limited to:</span>
<ul class="">
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autocomplete SDK commands inline</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code samples for commands</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example applications</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A beneficial everyday use case where SDKs are much easier to use than direct API calls is when developers need to perform complicated authentication procedures. Doing this correctly and securely with only direct API calls can be tricky, but most SDKs take these steps and make them easily implementable with just a few commands. The low-level API call parameters and structure are abstracted away from the developer and handled by the SDK.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In many ways, SDKs are the epitome of one of the main purposes of APIs: to give the developer the ability to build off existing technology as easily and quickly as possible.</span>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many developers, SDKs are the preferred method of interacting with APIs. For others, there are cases for making direct API calls without an SDK. Now that we&#8217;ve looked at both options let&#8217;s see why developers would lean towards one or the other.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing Between SDKs and Direct API Calls</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an ideal world, there will be an SDK available to meet the developer’s exact needs. SDKs cost resources to produce and maintain, however. And even when SDKs are available, there are quite a few situations where the available SDKs might not work for what a developer wants to do. Just to list a few:</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An SDK may not be available in their desired language</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SDK may not be updated to incorporate new API features yet</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both of these situations, directly using the API might be the only option. After all, it takes time and effort for an API provider to build SDKs. If there&#8217;s only one Julia developer using your API who wants a Julia SDK, it might not justify the use of resources.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even for the SDKs of languages you deem popular enough to support, it takes time and effort to update those SDKs. Functionality added to an API yesterday may not be supported in the SDK by today.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the vast majority of use cases, developers will appreciate having SDKs available and will eagerly use them. This is especially true for those who are making use of multiple APIs in their applications. For that reason, SDKs are worth the time and effort to develop for your primary user groups. The effort it takes to provide up-to-date SDKs will save them effort as they can seamlessly incorporate API calls into their app code.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for those edge case developers, those who code in esoteric languages, those who need maximum security control over what the API is doing, and those who want to be on the cutting edge no matter what, direct API calls are most useful.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great example of a company showing both direct API and SDK calls in their documentation is </span><a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>


<figure id="attachment_1522" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1522" style="width: 576px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1522 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/stripe.gif" alt="Stripe API documentation showing both SDKs and API calls" width="576" height="296"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1522" class="wp-caption-text">Stripe API documentation showing both SDKs and API calls</figcaption></figure>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both direct API calls and SDKs are tools that you should make available in your developers&#8217; toolboxes. And the more tools at their disposal, the more effective your developers will be.</span>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, the goal of your developer experience should be improving the accessibility of your product to developers of all backgrounds. Providing SDKs is the best way to make your API a little more manageable for them to implement.</span></p>

<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this API-driven era, offering just an API won’t cut it anymore. The APIs need proper documentation, helping code samples, and SDKs to ensure that the end-user quickly gets to the first </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello World</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While an SDK is a “make-it-or-break-it” deal for your API, it is just as difficult to get it right. Engineering the SDK is only the first step of this cycle. Once your SDK is published, it needs to be maintained consistently with each bug fix, feature, or new API version.</span></p>

<h2 class=""><b>What to Look Out For While Creating SDKs?</b></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">From an engineering perspective, each phase of building an SDK is crucial and comes with its own set of challenges.

<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The engineering effort required to maintain the SDK program explodes with the number of supported languages, as all the steps mentioned above for creating <b>one</b> SDK will need to be done for <b>each API and each language, every time</b>. Careful planning can reduce some of this cost, but the perpetual maintenance cost will still exist.</span></p>
<p class=""><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1426 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SDK-1024x676.png" alt="SDK Maintenance" width="381" height="252"></p>

<h2 class=""><b>Why Do SDKs Need Maintenance?</b></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve successfully implemented and published your SDK, the endless cycle of maintenance begins. Maintenance is required from an engineering as well as a business perspective, hence making the cost of maintenance much higher than the development cost, as again, this applies to the SDKs of <strong>each language per API</strong>.</span></p>

<h3 class=""><b>Maintenance From Engineering Perspective</b></h3>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think creating an SDK is enough, updating it is much more resource and time-intensive. Technology and APIs are continuously evolving, and SDKs need to keep up with them. You will need to update your SDKs (on time!) for the following reasons:</span></p>

<ol class="">
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Updates to the API</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: With every update to the API, the SDKs need to be updated for all languages simultaneously or the SDKs will lag behind the API updates.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>New language or framework versions: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This occurs more often than you realize and is a major operational burden.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Language ecosystem evolution:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> New IDEs, new build tools, major fragmentation in the ecosystem requires constant maintenance.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>New dependency versions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This results in more fixes, updates, security fixes, development of supported features.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bug fixes in the SDK:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You need to test and fix bugs continuously to ensure no blockers occur at the user’s end, negatively impacting your API’s experience.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3 class=""><b>Maintenance From Business POV</b></h3>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from the high maintenance required by your SDKs to tackle engineering concerns, you also need to consider business-oriented issues that may affect your SDK delivery and performance:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol class="">
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Lock-in on internal SDK team: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A custom internal tool or process that requires maintenance and a lot of engineering time/resources.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Speed of update:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SDKs and documentation lagging behind API releases unless you write a general-purpose code generator.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Opportunity cost:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Can other areas in your API program use this engineering time?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Time-to-market:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you&#8217;re just starting with building SDKs, when will they be available and what do you do in the meantime?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Operational burden:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Reduces developer velocity and happiness over time due to fighting fires, adds project risk to API program, increases costs for the organization.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Operational excellence:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Can you achieve the same level of quality and attention to detail compared to a company that exists only for creating SDKs?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Keeping the SDK program running:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Maintaining SDKs takes time and energy. Building it isn’t where most of the expense lies. Instead, that comes with running and maintaining complicated processes and tools behind the SDK program.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bls.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the median salaries in 2020 were as follows:</span></p>

<ul class="">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developer: $110,140 per year</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tester: $110,140 per year</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Writer: $74,650 per</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make things simple, let’s assume that building a <strong>single SDK for 1 API in just one language</strong> (including research, documentation, and testing) takes 4 weeks to build. This makes the upfront cost around $22,687. Now add in the maintenance time to 2-3 days per month, and SDK maintenance can go up to $29,089, bringing the total to $51,776. Hence, building and maintaining <strong>a single SDK</strong> in a fairytale situation, without any hiccups, can cost around $52,000.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now imagine if you&#8217;re building SDKs for 8 languages for 10 APIs, this will skyrocket this figure to almost $4M.&nbsp;</span></p>


<figure id="attachment_1434" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1434" style="width: 601px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1434 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TotalCost-01-2-1024x576.png" alt="Total Cost to Build 1 SDK in 1 Language" width="601" height="338"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1434" class="wp-caption-text">Total Cost to Build 1 SDK in 1 Language per API</figcaption></figure>
<h2 class=""><b>APIMatic as a Code Generator</b></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can choose to address all of the aforementioned issues yourself and write the SDK code by hand, or even try to solve your problems using an in-house code generator, but the process itself is quite hard and can take up to years to streamline. Not to forget the time and resource overhead involved. However, </span><a href="https://apimatic.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">APIMatic</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">can handle these issues automatically at the back-end for you, while you focus on building new solutions. APIMatic’s flagship code generator creates SDKs for multiple languages, including:</span></p>

<ul class="">
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP&nbsp;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruby</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# (.NET)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java</span></li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Typescript (coming soon)</li>
</ul>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">These SDKs are featured packed with thread-safe configurations, retries, logging, and more. The SDKs accurately map your API definition files into helper classes, model classes, exception classes, and controllers. APIMatic also creates comprehensive, language-specific guides with the SDKs that contain tailored tutorials based on your language and popular IDEs to help users easily get started with the SDK in their applications. For more detail, read here on </span><a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/overview-sdks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">APIMatic SDKs</span></a>.</p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">APIMatic creates SDKs from </span><b>OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0, API Blueprint</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>RAML</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as several other popular </span><a href="https://www.apimatic.io/transformer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">API specification formats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h3 class=""><b>Reduce Time to Market</b></h3>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internal SDK programs can become costly to maintain over time due to churn (new API versions, language features, and library versions or API program engineering turnover). If you are forking open-source code generators, it means you will be maintaining all the custom templates and syncing your project with the upstream for fixes/bugs perpetually. Also, there is no customer support.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">APIMatic significantly cuts down on costs and time for creating and maintaining SDKs in any language. You only bring in your API specification file and roll out your updated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SDKs in minutes, rather than weeks, months, or years.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3 class="">Automate SDK Generation and Maintenance</h3>
<p class="">APIMatic offers programmatic access to their flagship Code Generator, which allows integrating the autogeneration of SDKs directly into your CI/CD pipelines. So every time the API is updated, the corresponding updated SDKs are automatically generated, without any manual interference. Learn more about how APIMatic offers <a href="https://www.apimatic.io/continuous-code-generation">CodeGen-as-a-Service</a>.</p>

<h3 class=""><b>Ensure Robustness with Battle-Tested SDKs</b></h3>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDKs generated by APIMatic are already deployed by large companies and installed several million times, meaning that the SDKs are reviewed by a larger user base that helps us design better SDKs.</span></p>

<h2 class=""><strong>To Sum It Up</strong></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating SDKs in multiple languages is quite resource-intensive and expensive. Apart from just development, a major chunk of time and resources is spent on maintaining the SDKs, both from an engineering and business point of view, for all languages for each API. APIMatic is a developer experience platform that takes care of all the SDK generation and maintenance work behind the scenes while your developers can focus on their applications and innovative solutions.

<h3 id="d6de"><strong>Updated Language Versions, Dependencies, and Adherence to Coding Standards</strong></h3>
<p id="7773" class="">To ensure SDK compatibility with the maximum user codebase, the SDKs have been refactored to target minimum language and runtime versions and updated dependencies. Moreover, we have applied the latest industry-accepted <a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/sdk-coding-standards">coding standards</a> in all languages to the SDKs.</p>
<h3 id="cb43" class="">Immutable Clients for Multi-Threading</h3>
<p id="8e46" class="">We have refactored our SDKs to <a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/changelog/apimatic-code-generator-v3-titan#new-immutable-clients-in-sdks">immutable clients</a>that make it easier to write network-related code dealing with concurrency, as immutable clients are thread-safe and do not require explicit synchronization or defensive copying.</p>
<h3 id="c83a" class="">Timeout and Retries on API Call Errors</h3>
<p id="ecc0" class="">All APIMatic SDKs now support handling <a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/changelog/apimatic-code-generator-v3-titan#timeout-and-automatic-retries-on-api-call-errors">timeouts and automatic retries</a> if an API call is timing out, is unreachable, or returning API call errors.</p>
<h3 id="fe34" class="">Support for XML in API Calls</h3>
<p id="3a23" class="">All SDKs now come with the added support for <a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/changelog/apimatic-code-generator-v3-titan#support-for-xml">sending and receiving XML</a>&nbsp;in the API calls. So if your API definition uses XML, it can be imported into APIMatic v3 to generate SDKs without having to worry about serializing and deserializing the XML data.</p>
<h3 id="30e8">Support for Nullable Properties in Models</h3>
<p id="247e" class="">Java and C# SDKs now <a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/changelog/apimatic-code-generator-v3-titan#nullable-properties-in-models">contain nullable properties in models</a>, so if a user does not assign any value to a property after model instance initialization, a null value will be sent in the HTTP request instead of being skipped altogether.</p>
<h3 id="1b2d" class="">More Updates to the Code Generator</h3>

<p id="2867" class="hd he ds hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia dk ep" data-selectable-paragraph="">With a focus on helping businesses boost ROIs more than 100x, MessageMedia offers services for appointment and payment reminders, marketing messages, authentication and verification and for communicating with their customers’ workforce.</p>

<h2 id="e56d" class="ic id ds cd ie if ig hi ih ii ij hm ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix ep">The Challenge: Creating and Maintaining SDKs</h2>
<p id="dccc" class="hd he ds hf b hg iy hi hj hk iz hm hn ho ja hq hr hs jb hu hv hw jc hy hz ia dk ep" data-selectable-paragraph="">With communications going digital exponentially, MessageMedia successfully managed to overcome the challenge of providing 99.99% gateway uptime with its robust and high-performance networking infrastructure. However, this also meant MessageMedia’s developer relations team had to focus on increasing adoption and ensuring that developers had all the resources required to easily integrate their APIs. Sending over a billion messages per year and servicing thousands of global customers required a streamlined developer experience to integrate their various messaging APIs.</p>
<p id="7bda" class="hd he ds hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia dk ep" data-selectable-paragraph="">The team at MessageMedia understood that for ensuring seamless integration of their APIs, offering SDKs and code samples was an utmost necessity. But they also soon came to realize that manually producing and maintaining SDKs in 6 languages for each API update was not cutting it.</p>

<blockquote class="jd">
<p id="440a" class="je jf ds dt b jg jh ji jj jk jl ia cg" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="jm">“One of the problems we had with our SDKs was if a new feature was added to the API, we would have to manually make the code changes to the SDKs itself. Given we have 6 SDKs for each of our APIs, it was a long and inefficient process to update.”&nbsp;</em>— Ibrahim Tareq, Developer Evangelist at MessageMedia.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="0502" class="ic id ds cd ie if ig hi ih ii ij hm ik il jn in io ip jo ir is it jp iv iw ix ep">The Solution: APIMatic’s Auto-generated SDKs</h2>
<p id="16c2" class="hd he ds hf b hg iy hi hj hk iz hm hn ho ja hq hr hs jb hu hv hw jc hy hz ia dk ep" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is where APIMatic was able to meet MessageMedia’s requirements to increase API adoption and leverage their position across multiple platforms. With APIMatic’s CodeGen Engine, MessageMedia was able to <a href="https://apimatic.io/blog/2018/11/how-to-create-sdks-for-your-api-in-less-than-a-minute">auto-generate SDKs</a> in all of the required languages, and the SDKs could reflect changes in the API on the go, which had been a pain point for the team before.</p>

<blockquote class="jd">
<p id="5ba1" class="je jf ds dt b jg jh ji jj jk jl ia cg" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="jm">“APIMatic has helped eliminate the manual effort that was required to set up and get the SDKs running. There is quite a lot of work involved in writing all of that code”, says Ibrahim.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="87d3" class="hd he ds hf b hg jq hi hj hk jr hm hn ho js hq hr hs jt hu hv hw ju hy hz ia dk ep" data-selectable-paragraph="">MessageMedia certainly gained an edge with APIMatic’s auto-generated SDKs. Now they can ship SDKs to customers in a number of languages within minutes, while keeping the SDKs up-to-date at all times. The time to market has been significantly reduced, as the CodeGen Engine can generate an SDK as soon as an update to API is made, and even automate this process in CI/CD pipelines.</p>
<p id="7c19" class="hd he ds hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia dk ep" data-selectable-paragraph="">MessageMedia’s developer customer base has found it much easier to adopt MessageMedia APIs through the auto-generated SDKs and comprehensive documentation that comes with them for each language and IDE.</p>

<blockquote class="jd">
<p id="078e" class="je jf ds dt b jg jh ji jj jk jl ia cg" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="jm">“It has helped reduce the barrier of entry… you can hand out SDKs to your customers and make it easier and simpler for them to code their way to the first ‘hello world’.”</em></p>

<div class="col-md-12 col-xs-12 col-sm-12">
<p id="9d5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Here at Dude Solutions, we have two front facing REST APIs that drive our platform: Unified and Security. Unified provides the collections for driving normal business functions for our verticals while our security API handles account and user management. These two APIs are supported by a set of micro-services that specialize in different areas: Notification, Event, Report, and File. The short name of each gives a good indication of the primary business function that each one performs.</p>

<h2 id="e7e8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Need for&nbsp;SDKs</h2>
<p id="fdcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The first time we thought about SDK development was early on in the development of our new platform. We needed to communicate from our Security API to our notification micro-service in order to send notifications on creation of accounts and users. By building an SDK we now had sharable software that we could use across the entire platform. It reduced the amount of code in each API stack and understood our security protocols.</p>
<p id="01bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We decided to write our first SDK by hand. We learned that it takes almost as long to do the API implementation as it did the SDK development. In fact, it took one week to develop the SDK for a single language. We have 3 languages across our platform:</p>

<ul class="postList">
 	<li id="44b9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">C# for our API layer</li>
 	<li id="2d58" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Ruby for our API Automation</li>
 	<li id="6f93" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Angular for our UI</li>
</ul>
<p id="2383" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">That’s a lot of development time compared to the effort to implement the API itself. We weren’t getting the return on investment that we expected despite the reduction in code.</p>

<h2 id="2008" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Discovering APIMatic</h2>
<p id="015e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When we began to iterate over the design for the next micro-service, we started to look into alternate forms of documenting our APIs. We came across API Blueprint format, an open source documentation standard for APIs. It was easy to read and the syntax was familiar to our developers since it looked like Markdown format. This discovery lead us to APIMatic, and we quickly started conversations with their team. They got us up and running with a proof of concept within a couple of weeks. The POC demonstrated that we could drastically reduce development time by generating the SDK off of our blueprint documentation. Since the blueprint was generated during the design phase, the cost of SDK was absorbed by the time and money spent in design. Development time for SDKs for each language went from 1 week to 18 seconds thanks to APIMatic.</p>
<p id="b928" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 3 months, across the 7 SDKs that we generate, we’ve been able to save $20,000 in development costs. Additionally, the cost of maintenance is also eliminated because the effort to update the SDK each time the API changes is absorbed as part of the feature’s design cost.</p>

<h2 id="f5a9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Collaboration using Contract-First Approach</h2>
<p id="d209" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The one issue we ran into developing the first SDK by hand was the development teams working in silos. The initial design was based off of the implementation for the API. This meant if development on the SDK started in parallel there were differences in the API contract when compared to the expectations of the SDK. Teams had to slow down and execute in series: API implementation, SDK development, API automation testing, UI development, and UI automation tests.</p>
<p id="51c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Incorporating the API blueprint documentation into our design process allowed for developers to iterate quickly over the design of the API while having a definitive source of information for how the API would behave. The days of outdated wiki pages were over. Developers could now work collaboratively on design and work in parallel on: API implementation, API automation, UI development, and UI automation tests. We had finally achieved a contract first approach to development.</p>
<p id="48ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The contract first approach worked because we integrated the design process into our normal development process. The blueprint document is versioned in a Git repository. At Dude Solutions, we use normal Git flow for our branching model. This means each change to our API starts by branching off the development branch for the documentation repository. Then, developers can put changes to the API documentation into a pull request. This is beneficial because all of our teams have notice of the changes that are happening. Once a change to the documentation is made and pushed back to the repository our continuous integration system takes over from there.</p>

<h2 id="856e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Automate All the&nbsp;Things</h2>
<p id="b579" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We leverage a feature called “Feature Branching” in Team City, our build system. It allows for builds to kick-off for each branch when a change is made to our blueprint documentation. This gives almost instant feedback to developers about the change that they made. The continuous integration allows developers to generate a new version of the SDK seconds after a change to documentation and begin to integrate and test it in local environments all within a couple of minutes.</p>

<p id="1c0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">CLOUD M is a leading innovator of cloud-based native mobile apps for keeping people safe in their homes, communities, and workplaces.</p>

<h2 id="3bd9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Safety Network</h2>
<p id="757e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The company’s Alerter apps are used by New Zealand Government agencies to warn and keep the public informed during natural disasters and emergency situations. With population coverage of 1.4 million people growing to 4.5 million over the coming months, Alerter is a key tool in the Civil Defence and Emergency Management arsenal.</p>
<p id="383e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">CLOUD M’s latest product, Blerter, takes this to high-­risk workplaces, by empowering personal and collective responsibility for health &amp; safety across sites and projects. Blerter uses social networking, mobile, cloud, big data, and real-­time situational awareness to drive change and safety-­first cultures in industries like construction, transport, mining and energy.</p>

<blockquote id="be2c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The mission-critical nature of these systems means that responsiveness, uptime, and coverage are essential. The more devices client app platforms supported, the more people can be kept safe”, Alisdair Brotchie, Engineering Lead — Mobile, CLOUD M.</blockquote>
<h2 id="b51b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote">Evolution of an&nbsp;API</h2>
<p id="1541" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">CLOUD M started out as an API company, building significant cloud-­based capability served by a rest‐like API optimized for supporting sophisticated native mobile apps. As the products have grown in features and capabilities, the number of API calls and data models has also grown significantly to more than 400 endpoints and 600 models. The company is also expanding the number of platforms it supports from initially just iOS and mobile web, to Android, desktop, and soon windows mobile and potentially other platforms.</p>
<p id="85b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In order to reduce the complexity of re-­implementing such a large and rapidly evolving API by hand on every platform the company developed a tool for automatically generating client-­side native bindings for the API. While this worked well and provided significant benefits, the company had only managed to implement it so far on one client language due to resource constraints.</p>

<blockquote id="e655" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Our code generation tools worked well and really proved how powerful auto-generating native bindings can be. However, it was going to be a big stretch for us to expand these to cover all the languages we were going to need, and we just didn’t have enough engineers to do it at the time” -­Brotchie</blockquote>
<h2 id="8244" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote">Challenges of&nbsp;Scale</h2>
<p id="2799" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It became obvious that while the approach was right, the company would have to rapidly increase the number of languages supported, as well as improve the automation of the code generation to meet its business objectives. Along with this, the company is expanding it’s partner base and wanted to provide bindings in a simpler form for 3rd party systems integrators and other app developers. This would mean supporting languages that the company had no in-­house expertise in.</p>

<blockquote id="61cc" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“We see being able to give our partners a fully functional SDK rather than just documented API as a real competitive advantage — if we make it easier for them, they’ll integrate more services and faster” -­ Brotchie</blockquote>
<h2 id="3af6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote">Auto-Generated SDKs</h2>
<p id="36f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Before committing to a major increase in investment in it’s own code generation tools, the company decided to try out the <a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/overview-sdks">automated SDK creation service</a> offered by APIMatic. Being fortunate to share space in Auckland with the APIMatic team, the company was able to utilize their significant expertise in short-­cutting the process for getting to a successful trial.</p>
<p id="ab09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a matter of a few weeks, the company has a large proportion of its API being converted to native language auto-generated SDKs, and has begun building new client app on this SDK. It has also trailed the generated code for Objective-­C, Java for Android and Java for Web.</p>
<p id="efc9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The code generation process is now being plugged into the company’s Continuous Integration environment, which will rapidly decrease the amount of work for app developers implementing API changes or new features.</p>

<h2 id="5f9a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Risks and Rewards</h2>
<p id="5b9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">For any technology company replacing mission critical component of your software stack with a 3rd party solution carries significant risk, especially when failure can affect your entire user base.</p>
<p id="6426" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The CLOUD M development team undertook a significant analysis of the generated code, and worked closely with the APIMatic engineers to ensure that the SDKs met and will continue to meet the company’s needs.</p>

<blockquote id="8192" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“We’ve been really impressed with the responsiveness and enthusiasm of the APIMatic team, and the results we’ve achieved together. We now see APIMatic as a significant technology partner helping us maximise our resources and get new features to market much faster” Richard Gill, CEO CLOUD M.</blockquote>
