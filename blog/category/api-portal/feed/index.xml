<p>You create a great API and invest resources, time, and energy into it, but it turns out it’s not being adopted as much as you had anticipated. While your first instinct might be to investigate the API, there could be other factors at play here.<br><br>For starters, is your API documentation in-sync with the API? Do you provide only HTTP references or language-specific documentation? Are there any code samples that your API users can copy-paste directly onto their IDEs? Are there any SDKs that your users can integrate easily into their applications?<br><br>This might become a little overwhelming until you shift your perspective to how your API users are interacting with your API. Understanding your API user’s journey can help you identify where your API Portal may need more focus, so we break that journey into three phases:<br></p>



<ul><li>Discovery</li><li>Exploration</li><li>Integration</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Dty2T3dFow2x0t13mbRYRuMv9b3rBDv_-7m2MK_L0CJ8zeYOwTbTPGVIg8pQkzbOVIsMr89EW0pETGJjDFS38Gae4FzK6S5K60z383z82bGlke35NmQEUoSXeFuM8wTcWwxn9fU" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRl2JNwgu3g&amp;ab_channel=APIMaticOfficial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this webinar</a>, APIMatic’s Chief Product Architect, Mehdi Raza, and API Problem Solver, Keith Casey, present this perspective in detail and how mapping your API Portal’s features against each phase make it much easier to create a streamlined developer experience for your users. This eventually results in more adoption of your API as you provide them an experience for their use case specifically.</p>



<p>Mehdi goes through examples of existing API portals from the API consumer’s point of view and discusses the landing page, language-specific documentation styles, good and bad code samples, SDKs, and more. The interactive presentation is followed by an informative and conversational Q&amp;A session, one question being:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Q: If you could make one improvement to any API portal, what would be the one thing that people would benefit most from?</em></strong></p>



<p>A: <em>The one thing that people can benefit most in the explore phase especially is getting the use-cases of your API users laid properly, and figuring out which ones are the most important. So that you can make them the front piece of your API portal, and it helps out your API users straight away.</em></p>

<p class=""><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1697 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CustomrPoV3-02-1024x619.png" alt="SDKs and API documentation by APIMatic" width="744" height="450"></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The API community seems to have settled upon one ground rule: give the developers what they want, and then some more. Yay for the external developers (the API users), nay for the internal developers (the API developers).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exponential growth in APIs and the consequent competition between the API providers warrant the need for maximum developer experience with the least onboarding problems.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automated SDK and API documentation generations are a sure way to boost API adoption while lifting the strain of repetitive tasks off developers. API provider companies from various industries like communication, fintech, and travel enjoy better team productivity and faster time to market as the time-consuming monotony of maintaining SDKs and API documentation is handled by APIMatic.</span></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication APIs: Increased Developer Productivity for MessageMedia</span></h2>
<p class=""><a href="https://messagemedia.com/us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MessageMedia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is Australia’s leading global business messaging platform that offers communication services between its customers’ workforce.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending over a billion messages per year and servicing thousands of global customers required a streamlined developer experience to integrate their various messaging APIs, and manually updating SDKs on each update was not optimal.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the problems we had with our SDKs was if a new feature was added to the API, we would have to manually make the code changes to the SDKs itself. Given we have 6 SDKs for each of our APIs, it was a long and inefficient process to update.” — Ibrahim Tareq, Developer Evangelist</span></i></span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">With APIMatic’s CodeGen Engine, MessageMedia was able to auto-generate SDKs in all of the required languages, and the SDKs could reflect changes in the API on the go, which had been a pain point for the team.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It has helped reduce the barrier of entry… you can hand out SDKs to your customers and make it easier and simpler for them to code their way to the first ‘hello world’.”</span></i></span></p>
<p class="">Case Study: <a href="https://blog.apimatic.io/messagemedia-speaking-the-language-of-developers-with-apimatic-codegen-5a3a7ad17d8e"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MessageMedia Increases Developer Productivity with Autogenerated SDKs</span></a></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech APIs: Revenue Generator for Fortune 500 Fintech</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leading financial services giant provides access to the world’s largest independent payment network to almost any country in the world through API integrations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, this company was quick to realize that in order to obtain partnerships and integrations with third parties, they needed to reach out to a larger developer community and ensure that their APIs were adopted faster. They began offering .NET and Java SDKs for their APIs, which were built in-house, but maintaining them took the time that could instead be spent on expanding their API landscape with the growing demand.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Writing SDKs for just two languages was a pretty time consuming and expensive </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">process, every time we had a release that affected those services, it would increase </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">our sprints and dev timelines” &#8211; Head of Innovation</span></i></span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">APIMatic’s CodeGen Engine streamlined their process in the form of automatically generated SDKs and API documentation for six languages instead of two, directly from their API definition files. This resulted in cost savings of hundreds of thousands of dollars compared to building SDKs and docs in-house while reducing their time to market the APIs.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fast go-to-market time for documentation, and then the ability to generate SDKs in </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple languages; those were the things that attracted us to APIMatic.”</span></i></span></p>
<p class="">Case Study: <a href="https://www.apimatic.io/success-stories/fintech/a-fortune-500-fintech-company/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How APIMatic Became a Revenue Generator for a Fortune 500 Fintech</span></a></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operation Management APIs: From 1 Week to 18 Seconds with Dude Solutions</span></h2>
<p class=""><a href="https://www.dudesolutions.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dude Solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a leading software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider of operations management solutions for education, government, healthcare, and many industries.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have two front-facing REST APIs that drive their platform and are supported by a set of micro-services that specialize in different areas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dude Solutions realized early on that with SDKs, they would have sharable software that could be used across the entire platform. It would reduce the amount of code in each API stack and understand the security protocols. However, they started by creating the SDKs from scratch and soon enough found out that it was just as long a process as API development.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We learned that it takes almost as long to do the API implementation as it did the SDK development. In fact, it took one week to develop the SDK for a single language.” &#8211; Brian Hyder, Engineering Manager</span></i></span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they began designing their next micro-service, Dude Solutions started looking for alternate ways for SDK development and came across APIMatic. The autogeneration of SDKs in multiple languages helped drastically cut down SDK development and maintenance costs.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Development time for SDKs for each language went from 1 week to 18 seconds thanks to APIMatic.”</span></i></span></p>
<p class="">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1695 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dude-solutions.png" alt="" width="603" height="393"></span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">While they had initially planned to provide SDKs in 3 languages, the significant time and cost reduction enabled them to provide SDKs for 7 languages with APIMatic’s autogenerated SDKs.</span></p>

<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel APIs: Client Onboarding Time Reduced by 20% for Didgigo</span></h2>
<p class=""><a href="https://www.didgigo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didgigo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a digital media platform that assists travel agents in organizing and maintaining data, as well as creating detailed itinerary proposals that save time and boost sales opportunities for clients.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didgigo offers APIs that allow travel experts to create travel documents for their clients automatically and publish both digital and print versions at the same time. However, for a firm that excels at offering automated tailor-made solutions to its clients, it became critical to find a solution that could shorten the API onboarding time for customers, without the engineering team having to context switch on each release.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our process was extremely manual and required a lot of back and forth” &#8211; Keanu Ashwell, Development Operations Engineer</span></i></span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">With APIMatic’s autogenerated documentation in multiple languages, Didgigo is able to shift its focus on building robust APIs, without having to devote time and resources to maintain the documentation. The customer onboarding process has become more streamlined, with tickets raised during onboarding being <strong>reduced by 11-20%</strong>, and customer onboarding meetings going down by more than 7 meetings per quarter.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our experience with APIMatic and its provisions has been exceptional. We haven&#8217;t had </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">much time to maintain everything as we&#8217;re still strapped for resources due to COVID-19, </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">but we&#8217;ve still been able to rely on APIMatic to give our API users an understanding of </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what functionality we expose via our APIs. The ability to test [the APIs] is also a feature I </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">love and something that drew me to the service when we migrated from our in-house Swagger solution.”</span></i></span></p>

<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare/Senior Living APIs: Time to Release Down by 30% for Caremerge</span></h2>
<p class=""><a href="https://caremerge.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caremerge</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all-in-one platform that empowers families, residents, and staff of senior citizens by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">providing tools for modern elder care including family engagement, community engagement, chronic care management, and more.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caremerge also uses various pre-existing services to make them more accessible for these senior citizens, for example with voice commands. However, managing all these services in a single platform requires multiple internal microservices and a public API.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Caremerge API powers communication between the services they offer and allows them to build integrations with various third-party vendors and services. Building those integrations requires the documentation for the API to be always updated, so developers spend less time figuring out how to integrate.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using APIMatic’s autogenerated API documentation with the API playground allows developers to test inputs and outputs within the docs, resulting in quicker integration of the API, and helps Caremerge cut down on time spent on maintenance.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #999999;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“APIMatic helps us save 20–30% of the time it took us to manage documentation for our API” &#8211; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fahad Aziz, Co-Founder, and CTO</span></em></span></p>

<div><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can integrate the APIMatic CLI into your CI/CD pipelines for a seamless and automated experience. For example, every time your pipeline detects a change in the API, it can trigger </span><a href="https://www.apimatic.io/continuous-code-generation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatic code generation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the API without any human intervention and you can ship updated SDKs as soon as the API is updated. </span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a quick walkthrough of the newly introduced CLI, we’ll be using the Uber API specification.</span></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Installing the APIMatic CLI</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Installing the CLI is quick and painless. You only need </span><b>Node.JS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>npm </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a pre-requisite to execute the following command, and you’re good to go:</span></p>
<pre class=""><code class="language-bash">npm install -g @apimatic/cli</code></pre>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Validating the API for Unforeseen Errors</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Validating the API definition against robust internal checks ensures you have a smooth experience using APIMatic’s services. Fixing these validation issues before proceeding to generate portals or SDKs helps save debugging time. The </span><a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/rulesets/overview/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">validation output</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is categorized into three categories defined below:</span></p>
<ul class="">
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Errors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Any syntax/semantic issues found in the API definition.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Warnings</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Any unexpected behavior that may affect the output.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Info</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Recommendations or suggestions that can help enhance your API definition and its completeness.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">To validate your API definition, run the </span><b>apimatic api:validate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> command by providing the path to the file:</span></p>
<p class=""><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1634 size-full" src="https://devapi.dream.press/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/validation.png" alt="validate using CLI" width="637" height="91"></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The API definition validated here does not seem to have any critical errors and warnings that need fixing, so we can move forward to either generate SDKs and API Portals or transform the API specification into another format.</span></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generating SDKs to Speak in the Language of Developers</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the API is validated, you can proceed to generate multi-language SDKs from the API definition, directly via the command line. The </span><b>apimatic sdk:generate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> command generates an SDK in a specified language and downloads it to the specified destination folder.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, I generated a Python SDK from the Uber API using the APIMatic CLI:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1631 size-full" src="https://devapi.dream.press/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sdk.png" alt="" width="742" height="102"></span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now check the destination folder, where the SDK has been downloaded in .zip form. Extracting the .zip file shows the complete SDK files, including a comprehensive README to use the SDK:</span></p>
<p class=""><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1632 size-full" src="https://devapi.dream.press/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sdk-downloaded.png" alt="sdk generation using cli" width="661" height="323"></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use your favorite IDE to start building applications using the Uber API SDK straightaway. To read more about APIMatic SDKs, please refer to the </span><a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/overview-sdks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">APIMatic SDK documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generating API Portal for Higher Adoption</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">APIMatic embraces the ‘documentation as code’ philosophy, allowing you to specify all aspects of the API documentation as code. The </span><a href="https://www.apimatic.io/developer-experience-portal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">API Portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bundles API documentation, SDKs, and code samples into a static website. Just like with all products of APIMatic, the API Portal can be generated right from the terminal as well, letting the entire process be made part of the release pipeline.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to generate an API Portal, the CLI expects inputs to be provided in a specific format:</span></p>
<ul class="">
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">content </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">directory containing Markdown guides.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">spec </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">directory containing API specifications.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">static </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">directory containing images or any other static content referenced in the documentation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A configuration file called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">APIMATIC-BUILD.json</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="row bg-editor-hr-wrap">
<div class="col-md-12 col-xs-12 col-sm-12">
<div class="row bg-editor-hr-wrap">
<div class="col-md-12 col-xs-12 col-sm-12">
<hr>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place all the artifacts in a directory, including the Uber API under the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">spec </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">directory:</span></p>
<p class=""><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1629" src="https://devapi.dream.press/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/portal-directory.png" alt="" width="281" height="194"></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>apimatic portal:generate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> command takes the contents of this directory to convert it into a static portal’s components.</span></p>
<p class=""><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1630 size-full" src="https://devapi.dream.press/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/portal-generated.png" alt="portal generation using cli" width="624" height="80"></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The static website can now be hosted on a hosting service of your choice, let’s say by creating a website on Netlify, and the Uber API portal is live:</span></p>
<p class=""><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1628 size-full" src="https://devapi.dream.press/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cli-portal.gif" alt="APIMatic CLI Portal" width="1346" height="634"></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transforming the API into Multiple API Formats</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also automatically transform your API into more than </span><a href="https://www.apimatic.io/transformer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 popular API specification formats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including OpenAPI, RAML, API Blueprint, WSDL, Postman, and more. Many APIMatic users integrate automated transformations into their CI/CD pipelines via the Transformer API, which helps them take away the pain of having to manually rewrite the APIs. The same process can be replicated with a script that executes the CLI command for Transformer as well.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following example shows how the </span><b>apimatic api:transform</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> command converts the Uber API (in OpenAPI 3.0 format) to RAML, and saves it to a specific directory:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1633 size-full" src="https://devapi.dream.press/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/transformed.png" alt="transform using cli" width="682" height="130"></p>
<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation lets developers concentrate on business objectives and innovative solutions instead of diverting their time and efforts towards redundant tasks like maintaining documentation and building SDKs for each API update. Hence, the APIMatic CLI has been introduced as yet another automation option </span><a href="http://apimatic.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">among our growing toolset</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so you only need to focus on your API, while we take care of the rest.</span></p>

I faced a similar situation last week when I tried using a NASA API to observe our Earth via a satellite sitting a million miles far. The outcome: I did write some code, but ended up creating API docs for non-developers to see those gorgeous views without having to write any code.</span></p><h2 class=""><strong>Background</strong></h2><p class="" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On November 20th, I was observing </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExploreNewZealand/permalink/1525141897862733/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the recent lunar eclipse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with my 9 years old via a telescope. That reminded me of another telescope at DSCOVR (Deep Space Climate Observatory) which captures our Earth from a million miles (details are coming below). These images are available via an </span><a href="https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/api"><span style="font-weight: 400;">API</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but getting an image on a particular date required multiple API calls, and combining the images of a single day was not an option. Combined images help see a time-lapsed view of a whole day as well as give a side-by-side view of some rare occurrences such as the moving shadow of a solar eclipse, or the back-side of our moon in transition. Therefore, I wrote a small API on top of NASA’s API and published the relevant </span><a href="https://www.apimatic.io/apidocs/nasa-epic-demo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of both the APIs.</span></p><h2 class=""><strong>Fasten Your Seat Belts, We’re Going Deep in Space</strong></h2><p class="" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hold tight as we’re going to see our beloved planet from some distance. You can start straight away by </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://www.apimatic.io/apidocs/nasa-epic-demo/v/1_0#/http/api-endpoints/natural-color/get-solar-eclipse-days"><span style="font-weight: 400;">watching a past solar eclipse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (hit the Try It Out button, and change the date for different eclipses). Since the telescope stays at a </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lagrange point</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (L1), it can see the sun-lit part of the Earth 24/7. Therefore, in the case of a solar eclipse, it captures the shadow of the moon passing through different parts of our planet. The following picture depicts this scenario and became my motivation for doing this exercise.</span></p><figure id="attachment_1579" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1579" style="width: 699px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-1579" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Pasted-Graphic-1-1024x686.png" alt="" width="699" height="468" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1579" class="wp-caption-text">August 21st, 2017, a total solar eclipse over North America</figcaption></figure><div class="mceTemp"> </div><h3 class="">A Lunar Transit</h3><p class="" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you might have guessed, at a million miles away, we go well past the moon, so it gives us a chance to see the rear or dark side of the moon. Since the moon is phase-locked with Earth, we never see this side of the moon from Earth. However, thanks to DSCOVR, we can now see this spectacular view of the moon when it transits between the telescope and Earth. <a href="https://www.apimatic.io/apidocs/nasa-epic-demo/v/1_0#/java/api-endpoints/natural-color/get-lunar-transit-days">Try It Out via an API call</a>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><h2 class=""><strong>Non-Developers – How’s Been The API Experience?</strong></h2><p class="" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not a developer and have clicked the “Try It Out” button in either of the above links, then congratulations! You successfully called an API </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">without writing any code</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The left column of the </span><a href="https://www.apimatic.io/developer-experience-portal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">API Portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> acts as a menu to select getting started guides, API functions (also known as endpoints), and API models’ information. In the middle column (the API Code Playground) there are multiple settings to configure the output image including </span><code><b>gridColumns</b></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">(to change the image grid) and </span><code><b>imageQuality</b></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Any change in these settings is also reflected in the code on the right-most column. That’s how developers build sample application code based on their own input. If the code seems overwhelming, you may safely ignore it and hit the “Try It Out” button on the bottom right to immediately get the output.</span></p><figure id="attachment_1584" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1584" style="width: 1522px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-1584 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-5.png" alt="APIMatic Developer Experience Portal showcasing NASA API" width="1522" height="908" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1584" class="wp-caption-text">APIMatic&#8217;s Developer Experience Portal showcasing NASA API</figcaption></figure><h2 class="">Developers – It’s Simple yet Effective</h2><p class="" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might have guessed already that the combined images are being generated via chaining a few endpoint requests to NASA’s EPIC API. The top 3 endpoints are from EPIC API, while I added the bottom 3 endpoints. Interestingly, all 3 of my endpoints are hitting the same function at the server, while I am tweaking the input at the API level using APIMatic’s editor. I could have made an app to display the combined images but opted for an API because the use case was simple enough to be directly used from the API docs. Moreover, there are <a href="https://www.apimatic.io/blog/2021/09/the-great-sdk-battle-build-vs-buy/">SDKs and Code Samples</a> available for all the endpoints, so that the API could be used in different applications.</span></p><h2 class="" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>EPIC “Blue Marble” API &#8211; What’s So Special? </strong></h2><p class="" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The science behind Lagrange points is quite fascinating. Parking a space station right there, and continuously capturing the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere makes EPIC API quite special. According to </span><a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/DSCOVR/in-depth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NASA </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p><ul class=""><li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DSCOVR orbits about a million miles from Earth in a unique location called Lagrange point 1, which basically allows it to hover between the Sun and our planet.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EPIC API provides information on the daily imagery collected by DSCOVR&#8217;s Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument. Uniquely positioned at the Earth-Sun Lagrange point, EPIC provides full disc imagery of the Earth and captures unique perspectives of certain astronomical events such as lunar transits using a 2048&#215;2048 pixel CCD (Charge Coupled Device) detector coupled to a 30-cm aperture Cassegrain telescope. </span></li></ul><figure id="attachment_1573" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1573" style="width: 939px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-1573" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dscovr.jpg" alt="" width="939" height="725" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1573" class="wp-caption-text">DSCOVR orbits about 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth. Positioned between the Sun and Earth, this location is called Lagrange point 1. (Illustration not to scale.) Credit: NOAA</figcaption></figure><h2 class=""><strong>Conclusions</strong></h2><p class="" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">APIs have opened up new doorways to exciting information. That information is not available to common people until developers build “apps” using the APIs. However, some of the APIs, especially the ones providing data, can be accessed by both developers and non-developers via purpose-built API docs. And if the API is as exciting as NASA’s EPIC API, then we should not keep the non-coders away from such a nice experience, especially in the booming no-code and low-code times.</span></p><p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for reading.

<p class="">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you define the success of an API? Is it the number of developers using the API, the number of apps built using the API, the revenue stream it has created, or perhaps some other KPI? Whatever the criteria, the important bit is to constantly generate demand among the target audience, and keep measuring and aligning their activities towards the desired success criteria.</span></p>

<h2 class=""><strong>Knowing your Audience</strong></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defining an ideal customer profile is the first step of any demand generation strategy. Imagine after publishing a well-crafted API, you want to go out and start marketing it, but do you actually know what your ideal consumer/developer profile is? Do you want to target consumers of mobile or web or both? What developer community and platforms are important to you?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1545 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/audience.png" alt="" width="810" height="323"></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, your API is language-agnostic, but your targeted platforms and developers are not. Therefore, understanding the needs of a large diverse audience is as important as speaking their language. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNeZxbc4dtI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a talk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> elucidating how Twilio has created a phenomenal API experience by supporting a variety of languages.</span></p>

<h2 class="">How are Developers Interacting with Your API?</h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">After identifying the success criteria for your API, and knowing who your audience is, it’s time to measure how they perform once they have landed on your </span><a href="https://www.apimatic.io/developer-experience-portal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">API portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For this purpose, we are introducing a novel kind of metrics at APIMatic.io, which we call “Developer Experience Analytics”.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1548 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/overview-1024x285.png" alt="Performance Overview in API Developer Experience Analytics " width="1024" height="285"></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there exist a bunch of solutions to analyze API traffic, APIMatic’s analytics are focused on the developer experience with respect to developers and programming platforms. For example, it can help in knowing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how many users get to make a successful call with your API before they even start coding. Or how many developers are running into problems while trying out an API, and the nature of their problems.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a variety of metrics available, such as:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>

<ul class="">
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Time to First API Call (TTFC):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows the average time taken by different users to the first API call with the 2XX status code. Reaching the first successful API call means a developer has figured out the API communication setup and authentication requirements etcetera and is now ready to start integrating the API in production code. The time taken to reach the first call can help measure how intuitive and straightforward your&nbsp; API’s onboarding process is.</span>&nbsp;</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>API Portal Visits</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: represents the traffic on your API portal, but at a more granular level based on the languages/platform documentation visited.&nbsp; The language distribution can help measure the popularity of a particular language or gauge the results of a demand generation effort being made to attract a particular developer community.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p class=""><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1544 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/api-portal-visits-1024x417.png" alt="API Portal Visits in API Analytics" width="1024" height="417"></p>

<ul>
 	<li><b>Portal Page Views</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: portrays the most popular pages visited by the developers of different languages. This could be a great indicator of the importance of a particular language, endpoint, use case, or a custom guide.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1547 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image3-1024x415.png" alt="Portal Page Views in API Analytics" width="1024" height="415"></p>

<ul>
 	<li><b>API Code Playground calls:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> depicts the actual API calls made by users using their own data, right from the docs. The result of those calls, in terms of returned HTTP status codes, is quite insightful to fix any potential issues in the docs or in the developers’ understanding.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1546 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/direct-api-calls-1024x425.png" alt="Direct API Calls in API Analytics" width="1024" height="425"></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the API code playground also generates dynamic code samples, so analyzing the calls with respect to languages would also help identify the efforts and struggles of the developers of different languages.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<p class=""><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1549 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/trends-api-calls-1024x336.png" alt="Developer Experience Analytics " width="1024" height="336"></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">For further details and a complete list of available metrics, please visit our detailed documentation on the </span><a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/publish-apis/analytics-dashboard/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developer Experience Analytics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We aim to add more metrics in the future, including a few from the SDKs usage on the client-side.

<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s it like to call your API? Developers want to use your API to accomplish something, and you want to make it as easy as possible for them to incorporate your service. To allow developers to call your API directly from any technology, your docs provide DIY instructions. To go a step further and give developers additional conveniences and tooling, you can provide Software Development Kits (SDKs). SDKs include code to call your API so that developers don&#8217;t have to write it themselves from scratch.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">While calling an API directly vs. using an SDK does not change the ultimate functionality of the API, it can dramatically affect the developer experience. In most cases, one method will be preferred over the other, varying according to each developer’s needs, preferences, and skills. An SDK offers simplicity and speedier development but applies only to a particular development framework. SDKs require resources to develop and maintain. Direct calls offer platform flexibility and are available to all developers, but are harder to use without expertise.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we&#8217;ll be looking at why your developer experience may focus on direct API calls, SDKs, or both.</span></p>

<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct API Calls: The Basics</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For communicating with a service, sending API calls directly to URL endpoints is the simplest way. Of course, when we say </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">simplest</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we mean in terms of program complexity, not ease of use.</span>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">When using an API without an SDK, you make calls to its URL endpoints directly using standard internet protocol commands for transferring packets of information over the network. There&#8217;s no abstraction between you and the service, so every parameter must be written into the call. It must also conform to a standard format.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of how to construct a direct API call using Python is shown in the code snippet below. Notice the URL for the API endpoint is specified explicitly, alongside required header parameters that describe the request. This information is bundled and transmitted using the <code>requests</code> library, which then receives any response data returned by the API and stores it in the <code>resp</code> variable. Note that the cost of deserialization is added here for the API call.</span></p>

<pre class=""><code class="language-python">import requests
from requests.structures import CaseInsensitiveDict

url = &quot;https://connect.squareup.com/v2/payments&quot;

headers = CaseInsensitiveDict()
headers[&quot;Square-Version&quot;] = &quot;2021-06-16&quot;
headers[&quot;Authorization&quot;] = &quot;Bearer ACCESS TOKEN&quot;
headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;application/json&quot;

resp = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
print(resp.status_code)

decoded = jsonpickle.decode(resp.text)
</code></pre>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another example of a non-trivial API call can be seen here, pulled from the User Authentication documentation for the</span> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dropbox API</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>


<figure id="attachment_1520" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1520" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1520 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dropbox-1024x677.png" alt="dropbox user authentication" width="790" height="523"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1520" class="wp-caption-text">Dropbox User Authentication Docs</figcaption></figure>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For many developers, the need to specify every parameter is exactly what they want: the full power of the service at their fingertips.</span>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-level control can be unnecessary and overwhelming, though, especially for new developers. With just the basic building blocks, it can become a challenge for developers to perform more complicated tasks.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only can direct API calls be complicated to do correctly, but they can also be frustrating to try to troubleshoot. API response codes aren&#8217;t particularly specific when providing error messages; Many developers may give up after countless generic 404 errors.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, many developers will wish they could have something a little more prepared for them. For those developers, you can please them by offering SDKs in their language.</span></p>

<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDKs: What Are They?</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDKs are a compilation of environment-specific developer tools designed to access your API. SDKs make it more straightforward for developers to use your API using a programming language framework they prefer. For the developer who wants a little more guidance, SDKs will be the most appealing way for them to access your service.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDKs abstract away the minutiae of the API that often bog down implementation for developers. They can be thought of as an API wrapper that makes accessing that API more friendly to a particular type of developer. A developer has to download and install an SDK that matches the language of their development environment, where it will then provide a host of streamlined functionalities for interacting with your API. If the developer is using Python, for instance, they’ll most likely download an SDK through pip, such as this example from </span><a href="https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/quick-start/tutorials/quick-start-with-the-api-client/python/?client=python"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Algolia’s documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>


<figure id="attachment_1521" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1521" style="width: 721px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1521 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/algolia-1024x350.png" alt="Algolia Documentation" width="721" height="247"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1521" class="wp-caption-text">Algolia SDK download through pip</figcaption></figure>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The example call to Dropbox&#8217;s API, shown earlier, constructed with their Python SDK is shown below. In contrast to a direct API call, it does not require the developer to hard code a URL and headers. Instead, the API token is passed to a provided client object that handles those details.</span></p>

<pre class=""><code class="language-python">import dropbox
token = &#039;My-API-Token&#039;
dbx = dropbox.Dropbox(token)

My_Field = dropbox.file_properties.PropertyField(&#039;Security Policy&#039;,&#039;Confidential&#039;)
My_Template_ID = &#039;ptid:1...&#039;
My_Property_Group = dropbox.file_properties.PropertyGroup(template_id=My_Template_ID, fields=[My_Field])

dbx.file_properties_properties_add(&quot;/my_awesome/word.docx&quot;, My_Property_Group)
</code></pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While APIs aren&#8217;t language-specific, SDKs are. A developer will download the SDK for the specific language they want to work with. API providers that intend to offer SDKs have to research what languages most appeal to their core user base. Developers who have the use of an SDK will be incredibly satisfied by the bevy of tools made available for them, including, but not limited to:</span>
<ul class="">
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autocomplete SDK commands inline</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code samples for commands</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example applications</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A beneficial everyday use case where SDKs are much easier to use than direct API calls is when developers need to perform complicated authentication procedures. Doing this correctly and securely with only direct API calls can be tricky, but most SDKs take these steps and make them easily implementable with just a few commands. The low-level API call parameters and structure are abstracted away from the developer and handled by the SDK.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In many ways, SDKs are the epitome of one of the main purposes of APIs: to give the developer the ability to build off existing technology as easily and quickly as possible.</span>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many developers, SDKs are the preferred method of interacting with APIs. For others, there are cases for making direct API calls without an SDK. Now that we&#8217;ve looked at both options let&#8217;s see why developers would lean towards one or the other.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing Between SDKs and Direct API Calls</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an ideal world, there will be an SDK available to meet the developer’s exact needs. SDKs cost resources to produce and maintain, however. And even when SDKs are available, there are quite a few situations where the available SDKs might not work for what a developer wants to do. Just to list a few:</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An SDK may not be available in their desired language</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SDK may not be updated to incorporate new API features yet</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both of these situations, directly using the API might be the only option. After all, it takes time and effort for an API provider to build SDKs. If there&#8217;s only one Julia developer using your API who wants a Julia SDK, it might not justify the use of resources.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even for the SDKs of languages you deem popular enough to support, it takes time and effort to update those SDKs. Functionality added to an API yesterday may not be supported in the SDK by today.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the vast majority of use cases, developers will appreciate having SDKs available and will eagerly use them. This is especially true for those who are making use of multiple APIs in their applications. For that reason, SDKs are worth the time and effort to develop for your primary user groups. The effort it takes to provide up-to-date SDKs will save them effort as they can seamlessly incorporate API calls into their app code.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for those edge case developers, those who code in esoteric languages, those who need maximum security control over what the API is doing, and those who want to be on the cutting edge no matter what, direct API calls are most useful.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great example of a company showing both direct API and SDK calls in their documentation is </span><a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>


<figure id="attachment_1522" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1522" style="width: 576px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1522 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/stripe.gif" alt="Stripe API documentation showing both SDKs and API calls" width="576" height="296"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1522" class="wp-caption-text">Stripe API documentation showing both SDKs and API calls</figcaption></figure>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both direct API calls and SDKs are tools that you should make available in your developers&#8217; toolboxes. And the more tools at their disposal, the more effective your developers will be.</span>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, the goal of your developer experience should be improving the accessibility of your product to developers of all backgrounds. Providing SDKs is the best way to make your API a little more manageable for them to implement.</span></p>

Moreover, we have applied the latest industry-accepted <a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/sdk-coding-standards">coding standards</a> in all languages to the SDKs.</p>
<h3 id="cb43" class="">Immutable Clients for Multi-Threading</h3>
<p id="8e46" class="">We have refactored our SDKs to <a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/changelog/apimatic-code-generator-v3-titan#new-immutable-clients-in-sdks">immutable clients</a>that make it easier to write network-related code dealing with concurrency, as immutable clients are thread-safe and do not require explicit synchronization or defensive copying.</p>
<h3 id="c83a" class="">Timeout and Retries on API Call Errors</h3>
<p id="ecc0" class="">All APIMatic SDKs now support handling <a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/changelog/apimatic-code-generator-v3-titan#timeout-and-automatic-retries-on-api-call-errors">timeouts and automatic retries</a> if an API call is timing out, is unreachable, or returning API call errors.</p>
<h3 id="fe34" class="">Support for XML in API Calls</h3>
<p id="3a23" class="">All SDKs now come with the added support for <a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/changelog/apimatic-code-generator-v3-titan#support-for-xml">sending and receiving XML</a>&nbsp;in the API calls. So if your API definition uses XML, it can be imported into APIMatic v3 to generate SDKs without having to worry about serializing and deserializing the XML data.</p>
<h3 id="30e8">Support for Nullable Properties in Models</h3>
<p id="247e" class="">Java and C# SDKs now <a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/changelog/apimatic-code-generator-v3-titan#nullable-properties-in-models">contain nullable properties in models</a>, so if a user does not assign any value to a property after model instance initialization, a null value will be sent in the HTTP request instead of being skipped altogether.</p>
<h3 id="1b2d" class="">More Updates to the Code Generator</h3>
<p id="d4e3" class="">Apart from these features, the APIMatic Code Generator generates SDKs that support numerous features and enhancements like deprecating endpoints, cancellable API calls, access to HTTP response data, and more.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>For more in-depth detail on the updated features of the Code Generator, please head over to <a href="https://docs.apimatic.io/changelog/apimatic-code-generator-v3-titan">APIMatic Code Generator v3</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="21fd" class="">Enhance Developer Experience with Revamped API Portal</h2>
<p id="7c60" class="">The API Portal has been revamped in APIMatic v3 to make your documentation and code samples more readable and interactive, making API consumption even faster. We have also updated the Portal Editor for more flexibility in customization to the portal.</p>

<p class="">The success of bitcoin has given rise to an entire Crypto ecosystem that comprises thousands of Cryptocurrencies and other digital-native assets.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Much has been written about APIs in the Fintech ecosystem, but Cryptocurrencies have largely been absent from the conversation. This is in part because Crypto is not formally classified as Fintech, despite it being “Financial Technology”.</strong></p>
<p class="">Fintech or not, Crypto deserves a mention in any discussion around technology in the financial sector owing to the amount of interest it is garnering from institutional investors, publicly listed companies and even government institutions.</p>

<h2 class="">Cryptocurrency Adoption</h2>
<p class="">While institutional investors are adopting Cryptocurrencies as investment instruments, payment providers are laying the groundwork to begin using Cryptocurrencies for financial transactions.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Anchorage Digital Bank</strong> has become the first federally chartered digital asset bank in history. This is a major milestone for the Crypto industry, as it places Anchorage on the same regulatory footing as other national banks in the USA.</p>
<p class="">Mobile payment services are rushing to tap the growing Crypto market as well. <strong>CashApp</strong>, <strong>Square’s</strong> peer-to-peer payments app has been allowing its users to buy and sell Bitcoin for the last couple of years. Now <strong>Paypal</strong> has also jumped into the fray. Not only can Paypal users buy Bitcoin and other popular Cryptocurrencies within the app, but with the newly launched “Checkout with Crypto” feature, customers can also use their Cryptocurrency holdings as a funding source to pay at PayPal’s 29 million merchants around the globe.</p>
<p class="">Electronic Payments giants <strong>Visa</strong> and <strong>MasterCard </strong>also seem eager to join the party.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Visa</strong> has already partnered up with major Cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Crypto.com and Coinbase to launch debit cards to allow users to pay with Cryptocurrency at over 70 million merchants globally.</p>
<p class="">Visa is also launching Crypto APIs to allow users to participate in the digital economy. Although these APIs are still in the initial pilot phase, interested users can sign up to join the <a href="https://globalclient.visa.com/crypto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waitlist</a> to access the APIs.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Mastercard</strong> has revealed that it is planning to start offering support for some Cryptocurrencies later this year. However, details regarding the exact Cryptocurrencies that will be supported have not yet been disclosed.</p>

<h2 class="">Crypto Exchanges</h2>
<p class="">As traditional financial institutions gear up to enter the Crypto space, Cryptocurrency exchanges remain the largest stakeholders in this space. Crypto exchange data collected by <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/96472/monthly-crypto-exchange-volumes-broke-1-trillion-for-the-first-time-in-february" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Block Research</a> shows that monthly traded volumes on exchanges surpassed <strong>$1 trillion </strong>in February, a new record.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Cryptocurrency exchanges remain the first point of contact for most new entrants into the Crypto market, allowing users to buy, sell, hold and stake Cryptocurrencies.</strong></p>
<p class="">Contrary to traditional financial institutions who have had to undergo extensive Digital Transformation initiatives to cater to the digital economy, Crypto exchanges have the advantage of being digital-native. This is why almost all major exchanges already provide public APIs to allow programmatic access to their services.</p>
<h2 class="">Crypto Exchange APIs — Features</h2>
<p class="">Most Crypto exchanges provide 2 types of APIs; <strong>REST APIs</strong> and <strong>Websocket APIs. </strong>REST APIs provide transactional services that make up the core of the exchange’s offerings. Websocket APIs, on the other hand, are generally used to provide real time updates.</p>

<p class="">Virtually all of a Cryptocurrency exchange’s service offerings are accessible through its API.&nbsp;Since this holds true for all notable exchanges, therefore, merely <strong>having</strong> an API can not be a differentiator in an industry where every major player has one. What <strong>can </strong>set an API apart is <strong>API</strong> <strong>Developer Experience</strong>.</p>
<h2>Crypto Exchange APIs — Developer Experience (DX)</h2>
<p class="">Developer Experience will play a major role in ascertaining which API gains mass adoption in a fiercely competitive industry that is rapidly going mainstream. The most prominent element in an APIs DX is its <strong>Developer Portal</strong>.</p>
<p class="">How do the Developer Portals of some major Cryptocurrency exchanges measure up against our Developer Experience Checklist? Let’s find out!</p>
<h3>Developer Experience Checklist</h3>
<p>We look for the following elements when evaluating a Developer Portal:</p>
<ol class="">
<li><strong>Landing Page</strong>: What is this API and what can it do?</li>
<li><strong>Getting started guides/tutorials</strong>: Step by step guides for some of the most common use cases.</li>
<li><strong>API Documentation</strong>: Endpoints, Schemas, Authentication methods and any other conceptual information that could be useful while working with this API.</li>
<li><strong>Try it out/ Interactive API explorer</strong>: Make API calls from within the Developer Portal.</li>
<li><strong>SDKs</strong>: Client Libraries to cater to a number of Languages and Platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Code samples</strong>: Code samples for each endpoint, preferably in multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>FAQs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Change Logs</strong></li>

<div class="col-md-12 col-xs-12 col-sm-12">
<h3 class="">Bitfinex</h3>
<p class="">Bitfinex seems to be ahead of the pack in terms of Developer Experience. The API documentation seems to be well written and well organized and ticks most of the boxes on our Developer Experience Checklist. Open source SDKs are provided for Go, Node.js, Ruby and Python and are being actively maintained. There are also a number of community built SDKs for other languages and platforms. The documentation is interactive, allowing developers to make API calls from within the API Docs.</p>
<p class="">However, code samples are where we found the Bitfinex portal slightly lacking, with many endpoints restricted to code samples in only javascript; it would be great to see code samples in multiple languages to facilitate developers from diverse backgrounds.</p>
<h3>Coinbase</h3>
<p>The Coinbase Developer Portal seems to tick many of the boxes on our Developer Experience Checklist, however, on closer inspection, we noticed some issues, particularly around SDKs.</p>
<p class="">SDKs for Python, Ruby, PHP and Node.js are listed in the documentation, however, a quick look at their GitHub repositories will tell you that they have all been deprecated. There are a number of community built SDKs featured on the Coinbase Developer Portal as well, however, sadly, most of these seem to have been abandoned by the maintainers.</p>
<p class="">Code samples are provided for Node.js, Ruby and Python which is definitely where Coinbase has an edge over Bitfinex, however the Coinbase portal concedes some ground by not having interactive documentation.</p>
<p>Coinbase is also going the extra mile by maintaining a presence on Stackoverflow as well as a dedicated Twitter account for developers. This certainly earns them brownie points.</p>
<p>We did note, however, that the Coinbase Pro API documentation seems to have a couple of important DX elements missing, including code samples and SDKs, which is specially surprising since this platform caters to high value clients.</p>
<h3>Bittrex</h3>
<p>Bittrex has a well designed portal that seems to be doing the basics right. The documentation is well structured and well written. Moreover, developers can communicate with the Bittrex team by creating issues on GitHub.</p>
<p class="">Adding interactive documentation, code samples and SDKs would definitely elevate the Developer Experience for the Bittrex API to another level.</p>
<h3>Kraken</h3>
<p class="">Kraken has two separate portals for their REST and Websockets APIs with completely different design and aesthetics which had us double checking the URL to ensure we were on the correct website. Moving past the visual elements, the Websockets documentation seems to be quite well structured, with the REST API documentation lagging slightly behind.</p>
<p>An official PHP SDK is provided for the REST API but it does not seem to have been updated in a while. There are a number of unofficial SDKs featured on the website, however, they are accompanied by a disclaimer that the company is not liable for any losses incurred due to the usage of these libraries, so we are not sure of the usefulness of these community maintained SDKs.</p>
<h3>Binance</h3>
<p class="">The last exchange on our list also happens to be the largest of the lot, Binance. The <strong>Binance </strong>API docs do the basics quite well and additionally, provide a Postman collection to lower the barrier for entry. There is also a developer forum where developers can discuss issues with the Binance support team.</p>
<p class="">However, as with the other exchanges on our list, Binance also seems to be complacent in terms of SDKs and code samples. These would be great additions to the Binance Developer Portal.</p>

<p class=""><strong>To sum up, it seems that most Crypto exchange Developer Portals are lagging in terms of SDKs and code samples, which we rank among the most important elements of a great Developer Experience.</strong></p>
<p class="">Most exchanges seem to be relying on community built libraries. While we love open source software at APIMatic, we also acknowledge the fact that community projects tend to be neglected over time. API owners must also either audit these libraries periodically to ensure their stability or provide disclaimers for developers to use these libraries at their own risk, neither of which is ideal.</p>
<p class=""><strong>APIMatic solves this problem with its proprietary code generation engine, which is able to instantly auto-generate SDKs and code samples for any API.</strong></p>

<p id="9c8b" class="">While APIs form an important part of modern software development, it’s crucial to ensure that the utility offered by an API does not come at the cost of hindered productivity. Often it takes developers multiple hours to get familiar with an API before they can start building and integrating with it, however, a great developer experience can ensure developers get started with the least of steps and minimal time. In this blog, we will discuss how code samples help contribute towards an outstanding developer experience. We will discuss in detail what makes good samples, the different styles of samples, and how samples gel in with documentation and other elements to form a formidable developer experience.</p>
<h2 id="74b0" class="">Part I: Code Samples — Why Should We Care?</h2>
<p id="6565" class="">Learning new technologies is a complex task, even for the savviest of developers. Often it requires them to go through in-depth documentation, guides, and tutorials, something which they are very keen to skip on. What code samples do instead, is provide them with a task-based learning activity, which requires concrete action.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Developers love learning by experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="60f5" class="">Developers are hands-on learners and code is another language they speak. When they see code, they want to try it, break it apart, put it into action. It’s their favorite call-to-action, often when figuring out if an API is the right fit for them, developers would have already tested out the code samples on developer portals to make their choice.</p>
<p id="d54b" class="">This was proved by a&nbsp;<a href="https://eventil.com/talks/PPSznP-jarod-reyes-how-twilio-writes-documentation">user study</a>&nbsp;conducted by Twilio, where they found that pages with lesser words before code, did better than pages with more sentences before code.</p>

<p id="0a22">Before we further talk about code samples, it’s important to understand the need for them in the first place. Why can’t developers do without them?</p>
<p id="3347">And it all starts with putting an API call together. A lot goes into an API call, all these protocols, and conventions, and developers get all caught up in it, instead of focusing on their actual projects. It can take developers multiple hours to figure out what to put into a call, taking a toll on their productivity and creativity and all adding up to integration time.</p>
<p id="e3da" class="">What code samples do is put there calls together for them, in languages of their choice, so they don’t have to do it. Nicely done samples can get developers to&nbsp;<strong>the first Hello World</strong>&nbsp;with an API without writing a single line of code. Samples that go beyond that can be put straight into production. Which now leads to our next question.</p>
<h3 id="0d90">How many code samples can you write?</h3>
<p id="cae9">Not enough! Especially if you are looking for coverage of every endpoint. APIs tend to change and evolve and to update the samples manually with every iteration, even you somehow managed to produce them is not feasible.</p>
<p id="226a" class="">A viable approach here is to auto-generate these samples using an out of the box documentation solution. Different tools have different ideas on how to package deliver these samples. While some do the bare minimum, others go the extra mile to see developers have to put in as little work to get them running. It’s important for API owners to select the right tool to provide the best samples to their consumers, it should be a top priority choosing a documentation solution.</p>
<h2 id="db1d">Part II : Code Samples — Several Different Styles</h2>
<p id="3b6d" class="">To help API owners make well-informed choices, we ran a study to compare this different style of samples, which we analyzed keeping in mind the following qualities:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><strong>Learning Objective</strong>&nbsp;— They demonstrate actual (non-theoretical) use of API</li>
<li><strong>Runnable</strong>&nbsp;— Are runnable out of the box on a console and IDEs</li>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong>&nbsp;— Come with a playground to tweak them around</li>
<li><strong>Language Idiomatic —&nbsp;</strong>Proper language Structure to gel in with production-ready applications</li>
</ul>
<p id="d76f" class="">We categorized our learning into 5 different styles, the summary of which is categorized in the table below:</p>

In the case of Java, we had to configure maven dependencies for the build, and the generator could not pick some values such as the example body and the auth header, which have to be manually added.</p>

For instance, there is no body-serialization going on, all these different fields that have to go as arguments, go as one single string and there is no mechanism to put those values together in the form of one single string. These samples were found on Readme.io.</p>
<p id="7964" class="">What we also found missing in all three of these styles was lack of getting started guides, for instance, the HTTP client requires to be included as a dependency and then included as imports within the sample, something which has been left to the discretion of the user to figure out. For novice developers, setting up development environments may also prove to be a challenge, something which the samples or the documentation does not help with at all.</p>

<h2 id="21f7">Part III: Making Code Samples Work in Production</h2>
<p id="77cf" class="">Looking at the different styles of samples, the question that now arises is how practical are these samples to use? Do they completely replace the need to code, or are they just a push towards the right direction? Do they fully demonstrate the use case for the endpoint? Or do they just explain the logistics of making an API call?</p>
<h3 id="d87e">Language Coded HTTP Snippets or More?</h3>
<p id="6704">If you closely look at many of the auto-generated samples, especially the styles 1 to 4, what they essentially do is eliminate the redundant work of configuring environments, and help consumers figure out what kind of syntax to use. However, when making real-world use of API, you need a lot more. Do these samples, which essentially lack language structure and look like language translated HTTP requests, cut it? The answer is<strong>&nbsp;NO&nbsp;</strong>and for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><strong>No Data Types:</strong>&nbsp;The samples takes input and output in the form of a string, leaving it to the consuming developers to write an efficient i/o mechanism to complete these requests. Often the fields inside the body are not documented.</li>
<li><strong>No Data Models:</strong>&nbsp;Modelling the JSON/XML as classes make it easier to deal with the data, both input, and output. These “models” add a whole different layer on top of the API, with your application having to interact with the model, instead of queried response in JSON or XML.</li>
<li><strong>No Validation and Error Handling:</strong>&nbsp;Since there is no proper I/O mechanism, and both inputs are taken and output returns in form of JSON strings, it’s impossible to validate the sent data and handle error cases to determine what went wrong with the request.</li>
</ul>
<p id="d900">To further demonstrate our point, we will write a&nbsp;<strong>Sample App&nbsp;</strong>to make a new&nbsp;<strong>pet&nbsp;</strong>entry to a store. The app will utilize Code Samples generated by&nbsp;<strong>Postman&nbsp;</strong>for the endpoint<strong>&nbsp;Add Pet.</strong></p>

<p id="e551" class="">Following which we wrote the code to take in input values for these attributes. Now that we ensured we took in these values, with their correct data types, how do we pass these in the request, since the request passes the arguments in the form of a string. Manually doing this was, of course, unfeasible and out of the question, so we had to write in an object to string mapper to do the job for us. This took in these various attribute fields and put them together in the form of a JSON string.</p>
<p id="b586" class="">It was at this point that we were able to achieve a business use case out of the sample. We could pass in the input parameters, with their correct types, concatenated as a JSON string and passed along with the argument. The model allowed us to keep local records of the sent values as well.https://blog.devapi.dream.press/media/a6a1ace16d322eaaf541f83acf4905f9</p>
<p id="4294" class="">Working with multiple endpoints and multiple models would have taken us even more time, depending on the use case and business logic. For instance, for the GET endpoints, we would have to write a string to object mapper to parse values from the response string back to our model. While the sample does a great job pushing developers in the right direction, it is clear that it is not a plug and play situation. Developers have to put in a lot of code to get the calls running, and have to figure out on their own what goes before or comes after the API call.</p>
<p><em>Now imagine if there were samples that could take care of all these logistics, you had to write no communication code at all, and could just plug and play a sample into action. The good news is, you no longer have to imagine. The language idiomatic samples generated alongside an SDK already do that for you.</em></p>
<h2 id="21e8">Language Idiomatic Code Samples — The Way To Go</h2>
<p id="b15b">SDKs have often been labeled as the cornerstone of the API developer experience. What SDKs essentially do is that they abstract out all underlying details of making an API call, making your API look like a library. They provide developers a complete framework to model their applications, including all the necessary dependencies, referenced libraries, system libraries, i/o mechanisms, and class models.</p>

<div class="col-md-12 col-xs-12 col-sm-12">
<p id="4ce3" class="">Furthermore SDKs automatically format API responses to match the data types used in the programming language. They add an interface on top of the API, so your app interacts with the modeled data from SDK, instead of raw API arguments and responses. By providing SDKs, you can help developers focus on the business logic while taking care of API communication code.</p>
<p id="933e">Code samples generated with SDKs have a lot more work done on them. Since the SDK abstracts out request construction, none of the construction bit makes part of the sample, making the sample look very lean. Such samples can easily fit in with your applications in a very scalable manner, you only have to add minimal communication code, since there exist mechanisms to access, manipulate and work around with all the data fields, that go in and come out of an API call.</p>
<h2 class="has-text-align-center">. . .</h2>
<p id="308d" class="">Concluding this all, we strongly recommend that developers make use of code samples to consume APIs. No matter what style, design, or approach. Code samples will help you get started easily and save you tons of time. While for most people, the simple HTTP snippets may do the job, it is samples with more language structure that help with real-world use and can fit in straight with your applications.</p>
<p id="8467" class="">Again we emphasize the fact that the developer experience is a key driver for an API adoption. APIs are meant to execute integrations, and the easier to integrate, the better the API. Luckily for you, we at APIMatic hold all sorts of expertise to help improve the experience you deliver to developers.

<h2 id="37cc" class=""><strong>Problem</strong></h2>
<p id="b81b" class="">API documentation tells developers how to use a certain API. An API can have multiple endpoints. Developers read the API documentation to get an idea what does each endpoint do. To find out how these endpoints actually work they have to call those endpoints in their respective apps. Ultimately they find themselves jumping between the app and the API documentation. This wastes a lot of their time as well as focus.</p>
<h2 id="9142" class=""><strong>Solution:&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>Interactive API Documentation.</em></strong></h2>
<p class="">Provide developers with an API explorer where they can play around with all the endpoints while they are still reading API documentation. So they’ll have a clear understanding of what a specific endpoint does before diving into code.</p>
<h3 id="f2da"><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p id="053c" class="">To give a little background,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apimatic.io/">APIMatic</a>&nbsp;is a platform which helps companies improve their developer experience by providing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apimatic.io/developer-experience-portal">API documentation</a>&nbsp;packed with a lot of features. So we were about to add another feature which was going to allow companies to help their developers consume their APIs.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Help developers love your API by providing them everything required to consume it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="d19e"><strong>Process</strong></h3>
<p id="60f2" class="">Before I could get my hand dirty with wireframes I started asking developers questions like:</p>
<p id="d1aa" class="">1- How would you feel if you could interact with API Documentation?</p>
<p id="6ea3">2- How would you feel if you could try out endpoints while reading the API documentation?</p>
<p id="0051">3- Have you ever come across an interactive API documentation?</p>
<p id="d2cb" class="">4- What comes in your mind when you hear “interactive API Documentation”?</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>One thing got pretty clear at this point. Developers don’t like moving back and forth between docs and their IDE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="57a3" class="">Once I got the validation from the developer community I started studying other API Documentation tools. They all focused on all text and no interaction.</p>
