<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s it like to call your API? Developers want to use your API to accomplish something, and you want to make it as easy as possible for them to incorporate your service. To allow developers to call your API directly from any technology, your docs provide DIY instructions. To go a step further and give developers additional conveniences and tooling, you can provide Software Development Kits (SDKs). SDKs include code to call your API so that developers don&#8217;t have to write it themselves from scratch.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">While calling an API directly vs. using an SDK does not change the ultimate functionality of the API, it can dramatically affect the developer experience. In most cases, one method will be preferred over the other, varying according to each developer’s needs, preferences, and skills. An SDK offers simplicity and speedier development but applies only to a particular development framework. SDKs require resources to develop and maintain. Direct calls offer platform flexibility and are available to all developers, but are harder to use without expertise.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we&#8217;ll be looking at why your developer experience may focus on direct API calls, SDKs, or both.</span></p>

<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct API Calls: The Basics</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For communicating with a service, sending API calls directly to URL endpoints is the simplest way. Of course, when we say </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">simplest</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we mean in terms of program complexity, not ease of use.</span>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">When using an API without an SDK, you make calls to its URL endpoints directly using standard internet protocol commands for transferring packets of information over the network. There&#8217;s no abstraction between you and the service, so every parameter must be written into the call. It must also conform to a standard format.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of how to construct a direct API call using Python is shown in the code snippet below. Notice the URL for the API endpoint is specified explicitly, alongside required header parameters that describe the request. This information is bundled and transmitted using the <code>requests</code> library, which then receives any response data returned by the API and stores it in the <code>resp</code> variable. Note that the cost of deserialization is added here for the API call.</span></p>

<pre class=""><code class="language-python">import requests
from requests.structures import CaseInsensitiveDict

url = &quot;https://connect.squareup.com/v2/payments&quot;

headers = CaseInsensitiveDict()
headers[&quot;Square-Version&quot;] = &quot;2021-06-16&quot;
headers[&quot;Authorization&quot;] = &quot;Bearer ACCESS TOKEN&quot;
headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;application/json&quot;

resp = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
print(resp.status_code)

decoded = jsonpickle.decode(resp.text)
</code></pre>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another example of a non-trivial API call can be seen here, pulled from the User Authentication documentation for the</span> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dropbox API</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>


<figure id="attachment_1520" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1520" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1520 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dropbox-1024x677.png" alt="dropbox user authentication" width="790" height="523"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1520" class="wp-caption-text">Dropbox User Authentication Docs</figcaption></figure>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For many developers, the need to specify every parameter is exactly what they want: the full power of the service at their fingertips.</span>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-level control can be unnecessary and overwhelming, though, especially for new developers. With just the basic building blocks, it can become a challenge for developers to perform more complicated tasks.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only can direct API calls be complicated to do correctly, but they can also be frustrating to try to troubleshoot. API response codes aren&#8217;t particularly specific when providing error messages; Many developers may give up after countless generic 404 errors.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, many developers will wish they could have something a little more prepared for them. For those developers, you can please them by offering SDKs in their language.</span></p>

<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDKs: What Are They?</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDKs are a compilation of environment-specific developer tools designed to access your API. SDKs make it more straightforward for developers to use your API using a programming language framework they prefer. For the developer who wants a little more guidance, SDKs will be the most appealing way for them to access your service.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDKs abstract away the minutiae of the API that often bog down implementation for developers. They can be thought of as an API wrapper that makes accessing that API more friendly to a particular type of developer. A developer has to download and install an SDK that matches the language of their development environment, where it will then provide a host of streamlined functionalities for interacting with your API. If the developer is using Python, for instance, they’ll most likely download an SDK through pip, such as this example from </span><a href="https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/quick-start/tutorials/quick-start-with-the-api-client/python/?client=python"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Algolia’s documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>


<figure id="attachment_1521" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1521" style="width: 721px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1521 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/algolia-1024x350.png" alt="Algolia Documentation" width="721" height="247"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1521" class="wp-caption-text">Algolia SDK download through pip</figcaption></figure>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The example call to Dropbox&#8217;s API, shown earlier, constructed with their Python SDK is shown below. In contrast to a direct API call, it does not require the developer to hard code a URL and headers. Instead, the API token is passed to a provided client object that handles those details.</span></p>

<pre class=""><code class="language-python">import dropbox
token = &#039;My-API-Token&#039;
dbx = dropbox.Dropbox(token)

My_Field = dropbox.file_properties.PropertyField(&#039;Security Policy&#039;,&#039;Confidential&#039;)
My_Template_ID = &#039;ptid:1...&#039;
My_Property_Group = dropbox.file_properties.PropertyGroup(template_id=My_Template_ID, fields=[My_Field])

dbx.file_properties_properties_add(&quot;/my_awesome/word.docx&quot;, My_Property_Group)
</code></pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While APIs aren&#8217;t language-specific, SDKs are. A developer will download the SDK for the specific language they want to work with. API providers that intend to offer SDKs have to research what languages most appeal to their core user base. Developers who have the use of an SDK will be incredibly satisfied by the bevy of tools made available for them, including, but not limited to:</span>
<ul class="">
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autocomplete SDK commands inline</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code samples for commands</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example applications</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A beneficial everyday use case where SDKs are much easier to use than direct API calls is when developers need to perform complicated authentication procedures. Doing this correctly and securely with only direct API calls can be tricky, but most SDKs take these steps and make them easily implementable with just a few commands. The low-level API call parameters and structure are abstracted away from the developer and handled by the SDK.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In many ways, SDKs are the epitome of one of the main purposes of APIs: to give the developer the ability to build off existing technology as easily and quickly as possible.</span>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many developers, SDKs are the preferred method of interacting with APIs. For others, there are cases for making direct API calls without an SDK. Now that we&#8217;ve looked at both options let&#8217;s see why developers would lean towards one or the other.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing Between SDKs and Direct API Calls</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an ideal world, there will be an SDK available to meet the developer’s exact needs. SDKs cost resources to produce and maintain, however. And even when SDKs are available, there are quite a few situations where the available SDKs might not work for what a developer wants to do. Just to list a few:</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An SDK may not be available in their desired language</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SDK may not be updated to incorporate new API features yet</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both of these situations, directly using the API might be the only option. After all, it takes time and effort for an API provider to build SDKs. If there&#8217;s only one Julia developer using your API who wants a Julia SDK, it might not justify the use of resources.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even for the SDKs of languages you deem popular enough to support, it takes time and effort to update those SDKs. Functionality added to an API yesterday may not be supported in the SDK by today.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the vast majority of use cases, developers will appreciate having SDKs available and will eagerly use them. This is especially true for those who are making use of multiple APIs in their applications. For that reason, SDKs are worth the time and effort to develop for your primary user groups. The effort it takes to provide up-to-date SDKs will save them effort as they can seamlessly incorporate API calls into their app code.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for those edge case developers, those who code in esoteric languages, those who need maximum security control over what the API is doing, and those who want to be on the cutting edge no matter what, direct API calls are most useful.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great example of a company showing both direct API and SDK calls in their documentation is </span><a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>


<figure id="attachment_1522" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1522" style="width: 576px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1522 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/stripe.gif" alt="Stripe API documentation showing both SDKs and API calls" width="576" height="296"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1522" class="wp-caption-text">Stripe API documentation showing both SDKs and API calls</figcaption></figure>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both direct API calls and SDKs are tools that you should make available in your developers&#8217; toolboxes. And the more tools at their disposal, the more effective your developers will be.</span>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, the goal of your developer experience should be improving the accessibility of your product to developers of all backgrounds. Providing SDKs is the best way to make your API a little more manageable for them to implement.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">

<p class="">Bitcoin was first introduced to the world in 2009 at a price of approximately $0 per Bitcoin. In early April 2021, it reached an all time high of $64,800.</p>
<p class="">The success of bitcoin has given rise to an entire Crypto ecosystem that comprises thousands of Cryptocurrencies and other digital-native assets.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Much has been written about APIs in the Fintech ecosystem, but Cryptocurrencies have largely been absent from the conversation. This is in part because Crypto is not formally classified as Fintech, despite it being “Financial Technology”.</strong></p>
<p class="">Fintech or not, Crypto deserves a mention in any discussion around technology in the financial sector owing to the amount of interest it is garnering from institutional investors, publicly listed companies and even government institutions.</p>

<h2 class="">Cryptocurrency Adoption</h2>
<p class="">While institutional investors are adopting Cryptocurrencies as investment instruments, payment providers are laying the groundwork to begin using Cryptocurrencies for financial transactions.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Anchorage Digital Bank</strong> has become the first federally chartered digital asset bank in history. This is a major milestone for the Crypto industry, as it places Anchorage on the same regulatory footing as other national banks in the USA.</p>
<p class="">Mobile payment services are rushing to tap the growing Crypto market as well. <strong>CashApp</strong>, <strong>Square’s</strong> peer-to-peer payments app has been allowing its users to buy and sell Bitcoin for the last couple of years. Now <strong>Paypal</strong> has also jumped into the fray. Not only can Paypal users buy Bitcoin and other popular Cryptocurrencies within the app, but with the newly launched “Checkout with Crypto” feature, customers can also use their Cryptocurrency holdings as a funding source to pay at PayPal’s 29 million merchants around the globe.</p>
<p class="">Electronic Payments giants <strong>Visa</strong> and <strong>MasterCard </strong>also seem eager to join the party.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Visa</strong> has already partnered up with major Cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Crypto.com and Coinbase to launch debit cards to allow users to pay with Cryptocurrency at over 70 million merchants globally.</p>
<p class="">Visa is also launching Crypto APIs to allow users to participate in the digital economy. Although these APIs are still in the initial pilot phase, interested users can sign up to join the <a href="https://globalclient.visa.com/crypto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waitlist</a> to access the APIs.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Mastercard</strong> has revealed that it is planning to start offering support for some Cryptocurrencies later this year. However, details regarding the exact Cryptocurrencies that will be supported have not yet been disclosed.</p>

<h2 class="">Crypto Exchanges</h2>
<p class="">As traditional financial institutions gear up to enter the Crypto space, Cryptocurrency exchanges remain the largest stakeholders in this space. Crypto exchange data collected by <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/96472/monthly-crypto-exchange-volumes-broke-1-trillion-for-the-first-time-in-february" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Block Research</a> shows that monthly traded volumes on exchanges surpassed <strong>$1 trillion </strong>in February, a new record.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Cryptocurrency exchanges remain the first point of contact for most new entrants into the Crypto market, allowing users to buy, sell, hold and stake Cryptocurrencies.</strong></p>
<p class="">Contrary to traditional financial institutions who have had to undergo extensive Digital Transformation initiatives to cater to the digital economy, Crypto exchanges have the advantage of being digital-native. This is why almost all major exchanges already provide public APIs to allow programmatic access to their services.</p>
<h2 class="">Crypto Exchange APIs — Features</h2>
<p class="">Most Crypto exchanges provide 2 types of APIs; <strong>REST APIs</strong> and <strong>Websocket APIs. </strong>REST APIs provide transactional services that make up the core of the exchange’s offerings. Websocket APIs, on the other hand, are generally used to provide real time updates.</p>

<p class="">Virtually all of a Cryptocurrency exchange’s service offerings are accessible through its API.&nbsp;Since this holds true for all notable exchanges, therefore, merely <strong>having</strong> an API can not be a differentiator in an industry where every major player has one. What <strong>can </strong>set an API apart is <strong>API</strong> <strong>Developer Experience</strong>.</p>
<h2>Crypto Exchange APIs — Developer Experience (DX)</h2>
<p class="">Developer Experience will play a major role in ascertaining which API gains mass adoption in a fiercely competitive industry that is rapidly going mainstream. The most prominent element in an APIs DX is its <strong>Developer Portal</strong>.</p>
<p class="">How do the Developer Portals of some major Cryptocurrency exchanges measure up against our Developer Experience Checklist? Let’s find out!</p>
<h3>Developer Experience Checklist</h3>
<p>We look for the following elements when evaluating a Developer Portal:</p>
<ol class="">
<li><strong>Landing Page</strong>: What is this API and what can it do?</li>
<li><strong>Getting started guides/tutorials</strong>: Step by step guides for some of the most common use cases.</li>
<li><strong>API Documentation</strong>: Endpoints, Schemas, Authentication methods and any other conceptual information that could be useful while working with this API.</li>
<li><strong>Try it out/ Interactive API explorer</strong>: Make API calls from within the Developer Portal.</li>
<li><strong>SDKs</strong>: Client Libraries to cater to a number of Languages and Platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Code samples</strong>: Code samples for each endpoint, preferably in multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>FAQs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Change Logs</strong></li>

<h3 class="">Bitfinex</h3>
<p class="">Bitfinex seems to be ahead of the pack in terms of Developer Experience. The API documentation seems to be well written and well organized and ticks most of the boxes on our Developer Experience Checklist. Open source SDKs are provided for Go, Node.js, Ruby and Python and are being actively maintained. There are also a number of community built SDKs for other languages and platforms. The documentation is interactive, allowing developers to make API calls from within the API Docs.</p>
<p class="">However, code samples are where we found the Bitfinex portal slightly lacking, with many endpoints restricted to code samples in only javascript; it would be great to see code samples in multiple languages to facilitate developers from diverse backgrounds.</p>
<h3>Coinbase</h3>
<p>The Coinbase Developer Portal seems to tick many of the boxes on our Developer Experience Checklist, however, on closer inspection, we noticed some issues, particularly around SDKs.</p>
<p class="">SDKs for Python, Ruby, PHP and Node.js are listed in the documentation, however, a quick look at their GitHub repositories will tell you that they have all been deprecated. There are a number of community built SDKs featured on the Coinbase Developer Portal as well, however, sadly, most of these seem to have been abandoned by the maintainers.</p>
<p class="">Code samples are provided for Node.js, Ruby and Python which is definitely where Coinbase has an edge over Bitfinex, however the Coinbase portal concedes some ground by not having interactive documentation.</p>
<p>Coinbase is also going the extra mile by maintaining a presence on Stackoverflow as well as a dedicated Twitter account for developers. This certainly earns them brownie points.</p>
<p>We did note, however, that the Coinbase Pro API documentation seems to have a couple of important DX elements missing, including code samples and SDKs, which is specially surprising since this platform caters to high value clients.</p>
<h3>Bittrex</h3>
<p>Bittrex has a well designed portal that seems to be doing the basics right. The documentation is well structured and well written. Moreover, developers can communicate with the Bittrex team by creating issues on GitHub.</p>
<p class="">Adding interactive documentation, code samples and SDKs would definitely elevate the Developer Experience for the Bittrex API to another level.</p>
<h3>Kraken</h3>
<p class="">Kraken has two separate portals for their REST and Websockets APIs with completely different design and aesthetics which had us double checking the URL to ensure we were on the correct website. Moving past the visual elements, the Websockets documentation seems to be quite well structured, with the REST API documentation lagging slightly behind.</p>
<p>An official PHP SDK is provided for the REST API but it does not seem to have been updated in a while. There are a number of unofficial SDKs featured on the website, however, they are accompanied by a disclaimer that the company is not liable for any losses incurred due to the usage of these libraries, so we are not sure of the usefulness of these community maintained SDKs.</p>
<h3>Binance</h3>
<p class="">The last exchange on our list also happens to be the largest of the lot, Binance. The <strong>Binance </strong>API docs do the basics quite well and additionally, provide a Postman collection to lower the barrier for entry. There is also a developer forum where developers can discuss issues with the Binance support team.</p>
<p class="">However, as with the other exchanges on our list, Binance also seems to be complacent in terms of SDKs and code samples. These would be great additions to the Binance Developer Portal.</p>

<p class=""><strong>To sum up, it seems that most Crypto exchange Developer Portals are lagging in terms of SDKs and code samples, which we rank among the most important elements of a great Developer Experience.</strong></p>
<p class="">Most exchanges seem to be relying on community built libraries. While we love open source software at APIMatic, we also acknowledge the fact that community projects tend to be neglected over time. API owners must also either audit these libraries periodically to ensure their stability or provide disclaimers for developers to use these libraries at their own risk, neither of which is ideal.</p>
<p class=""><strong>APIMatic solves this problem with its proprietary code generation engine, which is able to instantly auto-generate SDKs and code samples for any API.</strong></p>

<p id="9c8b" class="">While APIs form an important part of modern software development, it’s crucial to ensure that the utility offered by an API does not come at the cost of hindered productivity. Often it takes developers multiple hours to get familiar with an API before they can start building and integrating with it, however, a great developer experience can ensure developers get started with the least of steps and minimal time. In this blog, we will discuss how code samples help contribute towards an outstanding developer experience. We will discuss in detail what makes good samples, the different styles of samples, and how samples gel in with documentation and other elements to form a formidable developer experience.</p>
<h2 id="74b0" class="">Part I: Code Samples — Why Should We Care?</h2>
<p id="6565" class="">Learning new technologies is a complex task, even for the savviest of developers. Often it requires them to go through in-depth documentation, guides, and tutorials, something which they are very keen to skip on. What code samples do instead, is provide them with a task-based learning activity, which requires concrete action.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Developers love learning by experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="60f5" class="">Developers are hands-on learners and code is another language they speak. When they see code, they want to try it, break it apart, put it into action. It’s their favorite call-to-action, often when figuring out if an API is the right fit for them, developers would have already tested out the code samples on developer portals to make their choice.</p>
<p id="d54b" class="">This was proved by a&nbsp;<a href="https://eventil.com/talks/PPSznP-jarod-reyes-how-twilio-writes-documentation">user study</a>&nbsp;conducted by Twilio, where they found that pages with lesser words before code, did better than pages with more sentences before code.</p>

<p id="0a22">Before we further talk about code samples, it’s important to understand the need for them in the first place. Why can’t developers do without them?</p>
<p id="3347">And it all starts with putting an API call together. A lot goes into an API call, all these protocols, and conventions, and developers get all caught up in it, instead of focusing on their actual projects. It can take developers multiple hours to figure out what to put into a call, taking a toll on their productivity and creativity and all adding up to integration time.</p>
<p id="e3da" class="">What code samples do is put there calls together for them, in languages of their choice, so they don’t have to do it. Nicely done samples can get developers to&nbsp;<strong>the first Hello World</strong>&nbsp;with an API without writing a single line of code. Samples that go beyond that can be put straight into production. Which now leads to our next question.</p>
<h3 id="0d90">How many code samples can you write?</h3>
<p id="cae9">Not enough! Especially if you are looking for coverage of every endpoint. APIs tend to change and evolve and to update the samples manually with every iteration, even you somehow managed to produce them is not feasible.</p>
<p id="226a" class="">A viable approach here is to auto-generate these samples using an out of the box documentation solution. Different tools have different ideas on how to package deliver these samples. While some do the bare minimum, others go the extra mile to see developers have to put in as little work to get them running. It’s important for API owners to select the right tool to provide the best samples to their consumers, it should be a top priority choosing a documentation solution.</p>
<h2 id="db1d">Part II : Code Samples — Several Different Styles</h2>
<p id="3b6d" class="">To help API owners make well-informed choices, we ran a study to compare this different style of samples, which we analyzed keeping in mind the following qualities:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><strong>Learning Objective</strong>&nbsp;— They demonstrate actual (non-theoretical) use of API</li>
<li><strong>Runnable</strong>&nbsp;— Are runnable out of the box on a console and IDEs</li>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong>&nbsp;— Come with a playground to tweak them around</li>
<li><strong>Language Idiomatic —&nbsp;</strong>Proper language Structure to gel in with production-ready applications</li>
</ul>
<p id="d76f" class="">We categorized our learning into 5 different styles, the summary of which is categorized in the table below:</p>

Samples for some languages were copy-paste ready, while others took a bit of tweaking to run.

These samples were found on Readme.io.</p>
<p id="7964" class="">What we also found missing in all three of these styles was lack of getting started guides, for instance, the HTTP client requires to be included as a dependency and then included as imports within the sample, something which has been left to the discretion of the user to figure out.

<h2 id="21f7">Part III: Making Code Samples Work in Production</h2>
<p id="77cf" class="">Looking at the different styles of samples, the question that now arises is how practical are these samples to use? Do they completely replace the need to code, or are they just a push towards the right direction? Do they fully demonstrate the use case for the endpoint? Or do they just explain the logistics of making an API call?</p>
<h3 id="d87e">Language Coded HTTP Snippets or More?</h3>
<p id="6704">If you closely look at many of the auto-generated samples, especially the styles 1 to 4, what they essentially do is eliminate the redundant work of configuring environments, and help consumers figure out what kind of syntax to use. However, when making real-world use of API, you need a lot more. Do these samples, which essentially lack language structure and look like language translated HTTP requests, cut it? The answer is<strong>&nbsp;NO&nbsp;</strong>and for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><strong>No Data Types:</strong>&nbsp;The samples takes input and output in the form of a string, leaving it to the consuming developers to write an efficient i/o mechanism to complete these requests. Often the fields inside the body are not documented.</li>
<li><strong>No Data Models:</strong>&nbsp;Modelling the JSON/XML as classes make it easier to deal with the data, both input, and output. These “models” add a whole different layer on top of the API, with your application having to interact with the model, instead of queried response in JSON or XML.</li>
<li><strong>No Validation and Error Handling:</strong>&nbsp;Since there is no proper I/O mechanism, and both inputs are taken and output returns in form of JSON strings, it’s impossible to validate the sent data and handle error cases to determine what went wrong with the request.</li>
</ul>
<p id="d900">To further demonstrate our point, we will write a&nbsp;<strong>Sample App&nbsp;</strong>to make a new&nbsp;<strong>pet&nbsp;</strong>entry to a store. The app will utilize Code Samples generated by&nbsp;<strong>Postman&nbsp;</strong>for the endpoint<strong>&nbsp;Add Pet.</strong></p>

<p id="e551" class="">Following which we wrote the code to take in input values for these attributes. Now that we ensured we took in these values, with their correct data types, how do we pass these in the request, since the request passes the arguments in the form of a string. Manually doing this was, of course, unfeasible and out of the question, so we had to write in an object to string mapper to do the job for us. This took in these various attribute fields and put them together in the form of a JSON string.</p>
<p id="b586" class="">It was at this point that we were able to achieve a business use case out of the sample. We could pass in the input parameters, with their correct types, concatenated as a JSON string and passed along with the argument. The model allowed us to keep local records of the sent values as well.https://blog.devapi.dream.press/media/a6a1ace16d322eaaf541f83acf4905f9</p>
<p id="4294" class="">Working with multiple endpoints and multiple models would have taken us even more time, depending on the use case and business logic. For instance, for the GET endpoints, we would have to write a string to object mapper to parse values from the response string back to our model. While the sample does a great job pushing developers in the right direction, it is clear that it is not a plug and play situation. Developers have to put in a lot of code to get the calls running, and have to figure out on their own what goes before or comes after the API call.</p>
<p><em>Now imagine if there were samples that could take care of all these logistics, you had to write no communication code at all, and could just plug and play a sample into action. The good news is, you no longer have to imagine. The language idiomatic samples generated alongside an SDK already do that for you.</em></p>
<h2 id="21e8">Language Idiomatic Code Samples — The Way To Go</h2>
<p id="b15b">SDKs have often been labeled as the cornerstone of the API developer experience. What SDKs essentially do is that they abstract out all underlying details of making an API call, making your API look like a library. They provide developers a complete framework to model their applications, including all the necessary dependencies, referenced libraries, system libraries, i/o mechanisms, and class models.</p>

<p id="4ce3" class="">Furthermore SDKs automatically format API responses to match the data types used in the programming language. They add an interface on top of the API, so your app interacts with the modeled data from SDK, instead of raw API arguments and responses. By providing SDKs, you can help developers focus on the business logic while taking care of API communication code.</p>
<p id="933e">Code samples generated with SDKs have a lot more work done on them. Since the SDK abstracts out request construction, none of the construction bit makes part of the sample, making the sample look very lean. Such samples can easily fit in with your applications in a very scalable manner, you only have to add minimal communication code, since there exist mechanisms to access, manipulate and work around with all the data fields, that go in and come out of an API call.</p>
<h2 class="has-text-align-center">. . .</h2>
<p id="308d" class="">Concluding this all, we strongly recommend that developers make use of code samples to consume APIs. No matter what style, design, or approach. Code samples will help you get started easily and save you tons of time. While for most people, the simple HTTP snippets may do the job, it is samples with more language structure that help with real-world use and can fit in straight with your applications.</p>
<p id="8467" class="">Again we emphasize the fact that the developer experience is a key driver for an API adoption. APIs are meant to execute integrations, and the easier to integrate, the better the API.

<p id="8d87" class="">Many of the APIs included in this study go beyond that and have added more value, building on these features. For instance Twilio allows sending of MMS messages, allowing senders to attached pictures or other forms of media. Furthermore, they have a mechanism to recognize the optimum routes to send out messages, ensuring guaranteed delivery in record time. Nexmo features a persistent sending ID, using the same number to send messages to one person. Plivo features number pooling, to distribute campaign loads and ensure quicker delivery.</p>
<h2 id="3099"><strong>Compliance Requirements — SMS APIs 2019</strong></h2>
<p id="8c9e" class="">For the telecommunication industry, one of the biggest challenges faced is being compliant with local and international regulations. Often continents, countries, states and even specific carrier networks, have a set of rules they abide with, and unless an SMS API caters to these rules, messages may never be delivered as intended and campaigns may go in vain.</p>
<p id="6064" class="">For most top SMS APIs, all these regulations are met and precautions are implemented, some important regulations and guides include:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><a href="https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/compliance/manual/8/viii-5.1.pdf">The TCPA (<em>Telephone Consumer Protection Act)</em></a></li>

<h2 id="57e4" class=""><strong>What Really Makes Great SMS APIs?</strong></h2>
<p id="6b08" class="">So by now, if you are trying to rate one SMS API over the other, you probably would run into too many of them offering the same set of features, with different implementations, all offering them one way or the other, leaving you guessing that which of them is really worth it?</p>
<p id="ecc8" class="">And for that, we take you to the question,&nbsp;<strong>what makes a great API?</strong></p>
<p id="5e94" class="">And the unanimous answer to that is great&nbsp;<strong>Developer Experience.</strong>&nbsp;All the best APIs are easy to consume and require shorter development time to integrate. At the end of the day, each API is supposed to facilitate interoperability, and the easier is it to integrate, the better the API.</p>
<p id="a149" class="">To see how these SMS APIs stood out, we analyzed their publicly available Docs and Developer Portals and came up with the matrix below, which summarizes our findings.</p>

<p id="4f3d">Where each of these API providers fills in quite a number of checks on the Developer Experience Checklist, each of them stood out in some respective fields.</p>
<p id="481b" class="">Twilio, Nexmo and ClickSend do a wonderful job with their Landing Pages, which do a great job onboarding users with what facilities they offer, what features does the API come with and how can they help them solve problems with tons of uses cases, tutorials, and Sample Apps. Almost all API Providers have made use of visuals and diagrams to explain the inner workings of an API.</p>
<p id="ef3a" class="">Bandwidth offers a Sandbox environment where users could play around with the API, similarly, MessageMedia offers an API console where Code Samples can be tried around with. Telstra has a run in postman button, where you can try out sample calls, the click of a button takes you to the postman tool.</p>
<p id="ec68">Both Twilio and Nexmo offer a dedicated API Service Status page, with intuitive layout structures that help consumers get to their desired bit of information faster.</p>
<p id="d7b9" class="">SDKs and Code Samples are also something that all these popular APIs have to offer, popular languages being: Ruby, PHP, Python, JavaScript, C# and Node.</p>
<h2 id="1752" class=""><strong>Great Developer Experience: A Challenge</strong></h2>
<p id="d64f" class="">If you are out at this making an SMS API, it’s essential that you miss out on none of these offerings, or you will stand no chance against the competition. Often smaller teams come up with brilliant technology but lack the numbers to focus on anything else except the core offering. It is just as essential to focus on material revolving around the API, the marketing pages, documentation, client libraries and much more, all of which take a lot of time, effort and energy, but without none of which your API will see success or adoption.</p>
<p id="54e5" class="">While companies like Twilio, Nexmo, and AT&amp;T can afford to heavily invest in programs like that, for startups and smaller companies it becomes impossible to spare time or money. With the cost and time it takes to produce all of this material, it’s not scalable with evolution, often Docs and SDKs lag far behind when APIs are multiple versions ahead, and this is the reason.</p>
<p id="4f0d" class="">So the challenge here is how do you take your brilliant API out to developers when you don’t have the means to keep it developer-friendly for long?</p>
<p id="050f" class="">And the answer lies in automation, while a human developer may take several days to produce and maintain all of these components, Code-Gen Engines can take an API Spec as input to automatically generate all of these components and all of it within a few minutes. Want to make updates to your API? Don’t worry, build the engine into your CI/CD pipeline and generate new components with every new push, release or update.</p>

To build up trust further, they have their API roadmaps up, so evaluating developers can foresee what the future would look like, helping them make a solid well-informed decision.</p>
<p id="381f" class="">Documentation for APIs starts with Change Logs and Version release notes. We believe that is a really important practice, early on educating users, what preliminary actions they have to take before going on with implementation are really important. We love how they set out the context, and answer any sort of considerations such as security concerns, terminology, rate limiting and all other queries a user may have before they actually get to documentation.</p>
<p id="7c35">The Reference docs are beautiful, come with a detailed description of parameters, sample call request, and responses and an API Console where those calls can be tried out and tested.</p>

<p id="ed81" class=""><a href="https://developer.barclays.com/">Barclay’s API&nbsp; </a>program is one of the largest in the industry, with over 12 well-maintained APIs and more in experimental phases, they have made sure they deliver a great developer experience.</p>
<p id="c59d" class="">Their developer portal is the face of their API program and they have managed the entire project beautifully.</p>
<p id="57ac" class="">On the Landing Page, they send out a very bold message about their mission, and with that list their APIs, customer stories, use cases and talk about open banking overall. Building upon the value of their offering is something that all API providers have done in this space and we cannot stress how important that is considering the competition in this fast-paced industry.</p>

<p id="bc42">Each API has an Overview Page which thoroughly explains what consumers can achieve from that API. Stripe goes an extra mile and helps users implement APIs in a number of ways, including pre-built UI components for both Web and Mobile, along with SDKs in multiple platforms.

<p id="278d">After that, they talk about the SDKs which the offer in 15 languages. For them the SDKs are an integral part of their offerings, hence are well tested and well maintained and they encourage the use of it, while also accepting suggestions to their main repository from the community.</p>

<p id="a8dd">Coming from an industry that is still emerging, it’s impressive how they check most of the things from the Developer Experience checklist. And their wide adoption should come as no surprise.</p>
<p id="c17a">Summarizing the research we found out, although most of these APIs offer a number of components from the Developer Experience checklist, it’s FinTech APIs that has taken the lead by offering SDKs and investing more in thier documentation practises. A developer coming in for a payment solution is more likely going to choose an API, which has an implementation available in a language they are comfortable with and is more convenient to use, hence no wonder Stripe and Square are global leaders today.</p>
<p id="889f" class="">If you are in the Finance industry, you too can offer an amazing developer experience for your API, and without putting in the hard work, time or dedicating resources. We can help you get started with your developer experience program from the Landing Pages, to Docs, Code Samples, SDKs, and everything.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="d6ac" class="">The Banking and Finance industry is one of the most heavily regulated sectors of the world. The regulations, although important to protect the integrity of the system and customer interest, come at the cost of hindered advancement and such had been the case for the industry.</p>
<p id="db59" class="">This was until the rise of FinTech companies, who leveraged APIs as gateways to expose traditional financial services so that third-party developers could build custom solutions on top of them. There’s a lot you can achieve with FinTech APIs, without having to go through the labor of manually implementing any functionality.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A simple query on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/search/financial"> ProgrammableWeb</a>shows there are&nbsp;<em>1956</em>&nbsp;APIs listed under the tag of Financial APIs, with around&nbsp;<em>290</em>&nbsp;listed this very year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="e432" class="">FinTech APIs are putting immense pressure on Traditional Banking and Financial Organisations, who are actively trying to catch up. Customers today expect advanced, frictionless experiences and banks with traditional business models are failing to provide them.</p>

<p id="d65f" class="">When <a href="https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_gl/topics/banking-and-capital-markets/ey-global-fintech-adoption-index.pdf">Ernst and Young&nbsp; </a>conducted their first study on FinTech adoption in 2015, they found adoption rates for FinTech as low as 10% amongst the consumers they surveyed. The number rose to 33% in 2017 and now stands at 64%. More and more individuals especially millennials, are shying away from traditional banking and instead are inclined more towards digital solutions put out by these FinTech companies.</p>
<p id="4c55" class="">It’s clearly time for banks to explore newer business models and to expose data and functionality in a similar fashion, acting as the infrastructure or platform on which financial services of the future are built. Else tech giants or startups in the space will ultimately wipe them over.</p>
<h2 id="d558" class="">Open Banking and Europe’s PSD2</h2>
<p id="9911" class="">In 2015 the European Parliament adopted new legislation, Payment Services Directive 2 better known as <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/mip-online/2018/html/1803_revisedpsd.en.html">PSD2</a>, to streamline the digitalisation of banks and financial services. The directive obligates banks across Europe to make banking data and services available to third-party developers, so they can build value-added services on top of them.</p>
<p id="dca9">The concept of Open Banking, on the other hand, has been around for much longer and it suggests that banks provide access to user data via Open APIs, so that they can partner with external entities to improve customer experience.</p>
<p id="0b6b" class="">The Open Banking Initiative is powering PSD2 today, for which deadlines are running out and banks are putting out APIs on a daily basis. The directive has provided Banks with an excellent opportunity to make their mark, tight deadlines have forced banks to work faster on API preparation, resulting in 529 Banking APIs publicly listed as of today.</p>
<p id="4a24">Banks, because of the initiative, and the legislation are on their way to make a comeback, but is just putting out an API enough?</p>
<h2 id="33c8" class="">Developer Experience Makes APIs Useable</h2>
<p id="5ca8" class="">Developers today have a wide array of choices. A number of Banking and Finance APIs today provide the same utility and services, some implementing them in a different manner, some adopting different technology stacks, but what truly sets these APIs apart is the ease when it comes to consumption.</p>
<p id="07ff" class="">Developers want to get started as soon as possible, spend as little time getting acquainted with the API, and focus more on building creative solutions on top of them. In order for an API to be widely adopted, it must have a great developer experience.</p>
<p id="0ba7" class="">Since Developer Experience is a huge deciding factor when it comes to adopting an API, we sat down and shortlisted 8 popular Banking and Finance APIs and analysed what they have to offer in terms of Developer Experience, and what makes them popular choices amongst developers.</p>
<p id="6fa9" class="">Using the famous Developer Experience checklist as criteria and point of reference, we noticed some common trends and practices, which are objectively summarised in the table below:</p>

<p id="19ca" class="">Quickly skimming through the table you would notice that most of these APIs offer a number of components from the Developer Experience checklist, and hence comes as no surprise why they are doing so well. One area we saw FinTech APIs lead, was with offering API implementations in multiple languages, in the form of SDKs, so developers can instantly start making use of these APIs in languages they are comfortable with.</p>
<p id="91fc" class="">We further ran a detailed analysis to find out how these APIs have gone about with their Developer Experience and what sets them apart from each other and remaining of the competition, which you can go through here:&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.apimatic.io/popular-developer-experience-practices-fintech-and-banking-apis-a5474fe535e4"> Popular Developer Experience Practices: FinTech and Banking APIs.</a></p>
<h3 id="8e19"><strong>PSD2 is an Opportunity for Digital Transformation</strong></h3>
<p id="2287" class="">FinTech APIs have built popularity, cashing on the exemplary experiences they provide, both to developers and customers, and Banking APIs that have followed suit have done well. But this is not the case for every bank out there. PSD2, although very explicitly requires banks to open up data and banking functionalities, it does not specify how banks are supposed to meet these requirements, with many just checking them off with bare minimum implementations.</p>
<p id="8b13" class="">Banks that are looking to just adhere to regulatory requirements and not do more, may miss out on big opportunities to expand and grow new business models, and may not be able to put themselves on the map with FinTech APIs.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>According to a survey, only 59% of Europe’s 442 banks met PSD2’s 14th March deadline, to have a publicly available testing facility or a sandbox environment .</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="a963">Of course, it is easier said than done and many banks are still struggling to prepare their APIs, with most of them slacking behind. In order to fulfill legal requirements, the API experience gets second fiddle. While understandable, it leads to a missed opportunity nonetheless</p>
<p id="adf4" class="">With the final 29th September deadline looming ahead, a number of Banking APIs are going to hit the markets, and only the ones that come with a developer experience will catch all the buzz, leaving the rest trailing on traction.</p>
<h2 id="32b5" class="">Automation is the Key to Scaling Developer Experience</h2>
<p id="0227" class="">So where does this leave API teams today who are still working on their API and have no time or resources to work on the consumption part of it?</p>
<p id="8a9a" class="">And the answer lies in&nbsp;<strong>Automation</strong>.</p>
<p id="833d" class="">With all hands busy on deck working on the core functionality of APIs, there is no reason that resources have to be dedicated to just work on producing the artifacts that make APIs easier to consume. Instead, let the machines do the working for you!</p>
<p id="3749">A lot can be done with an API Specification today. The document, when passed through CodeGen engines, can drive entire Developer Experience(DX) for APIs with automatic generation of DX components. And not just Documentation or Portals, but also complex components like SDKs, Code Samples, API Explorers and can even CI/CD pipelines so none of this has to be updated manually.</p>

<p id="c145" class="">Many API Providers after accepting the need of giving out SDKs, ponder over what languages should they offer them in? The golden answer for this is as many as you can. Developers today are working with a number of languages and platforms, the diversity when it comes to adoption of new technology is all time high. According to a survey on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/news/what-programming-language-most-popular-apis/2013/06/03"> Programmable web</a>, these are the languages programmers are using the most to consume APIs:</p>
<ol class="">
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>.NET / C#</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>ColdFusion</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>ActionScript</li>
</ol>
<p id="aa4d" class="">Some of these languages may be losing popularity, and new languages are being adopted day by day but the fact still remains that APIs are being consumed in multiple languages and you need to cater the need.</p>
<p id="54ab" class="">Which again gives birth to the question:</p>
<h2 id="97f0" class="">How are you going to create SDKs in all these languages?</h2>
<p id="2d24" class="">While it may seem easy, writing client libraries for an API that you wrote yourself, it’s not so simple. It does not only require hours of redundant labour work but also a number of resources, loads of time and a lot of testing, making SDKs more of a chore. Companies who have the $$$ and resources to build in-house SDKs with language experts are at an advantage, leaving the rest dreaming.</p>
<p id="60c0" class="">Maintaining SDKs is a whole different story. Even companies with huge API teams struggle to update their SDKs on time. APIs tend to evolve and version over time and with every new update, the SDKs go obsolete. Reflecting these changes across SDKs in multiple languages in a way that does not break things is tough, time-consuming work.</p>
<p id="8a6b" class=""><mark>Simple maths reveal that around 83% of the total SDK cost comes from keeping it up to date and bug-free after every API update.</mark></p>

<p id="9cff" class="">Its safe to assume that in order to write a single SDK, a developer who is proficient enough to write idiomatic code is required full time. Assuming the developer takes a week to build and test that SDK on a pay rate of $46/hour (bls.gov), then the cost turns out to be $1,852 for SDK in one language.</p>
<p id="67a2" class="">Cost of maintaining an SDK although depends on many variables like how frequent the API is changed or what’s the size of the library. For the sake of simplicity let’s assume it takes two days a month on average for a developer to maintain an SDK. With same cost assumptions, the burn turns out to be $8,885 for maintaining a single SDK over a year. Summing up both building and maintenance cost gives us a figure of $11,000 per API per SDK per language.</p>
<p id="e055" class="">Multiply this by the number of languages or APIs, we’re looking at sizeable costs, for just manually writing and maintaining SDKs.</p>

<p id="69eb" class="">Code Generators are the engines which enable automatic generation of SDKs. They have now been around for some years but are still a new concept in the API space.

<h2 id="cc21">Goals</h2>
<p id="0c14" class="">Developer Experience is the most important metric to measure the quality of an API. For us at APIMatic it is the rule of law, it’s the word of god, it’s everything. We have always preached the idea of well-designed APIs that are super easy to use and make the life of developers easy. An API is not a random chunk of code, it’s an interface, and like any interface, you need to make sure that the experience you’re providing is as smooth and seamless as possible because that is what developers are looking for.</p>
<p id="284f" class="">With developer experience as the goal post, the direction we took for implementing our new APIs was very clear. Let’s briefly look at the fundamental concepts that were under consideration throughout the development cycle:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><strong>Stable&nbsp;</strong>and even more importantly&nbsp;<strong>Scalable</strong>&nbsp;APIs.</li>
<li>Making our APIs&nbsp;<strong>truly RESTFUL&nbsp;</strong>by adhering to the&nbsp;<strong>constraints</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<em>REST</em>&nbsp;as much as possible.</li>
<li>Ensure&nbsp;<strong>backward compatibility</strong>&nbsp;for our public APIs.</li>
<li>Focusing on&nbsp;<strong>simplicity</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;extensibility</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;reliability,&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;performance</strong>.</li>
<li>Sticking to popular&nbsp;<strong>standards&nbsp;</strong>to create&nbsp;<strong>uniformity</strong>&nbsp;in the code.</li>
<li>Prioritize&nbsp;<strong>naming</strong>&nbsp;and making it&nbsp;<strong>consistent</strong>&nbsp;across the application.</li>
<li>Improving the&nbsp;<strong>readability</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>structuring</strong>&nbsp;of the code to optimize it for incremental upgrades in the future.</li>
<li>Creating the APIs to be easily&nbsp;<strong>testable&nbsp;</strong>and then writing&nbsp;<strong>Unit Tests&nbsp;</strong>for them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="d943">The Richardson Maturity Model</h2>
<p id="a20e" class="">The Richardson Maturity Model is a great way to grade your API according to the constraints of REST. The better your API adheres to these constraints, the higher its score is. The Richardson Maturity Model knows 4 levels (0–3), where level 3 designates a truly RESTful API.</p>

<p id="4383" class="">Our previous APIs were&nbsp;<strong>Level 0</strong>;&nbsp;<em>RESTful</em>&nbsp;only in name as they were only using&nbsp;<em>HTTP</em>&nbsp;to send requests and receive responses without utilizing the full potential of&nbsp;<em>HTTP</em>. The APIs were used only to invoke remote mechanisms based on remote procedure call. There was some&nbsp;<strong>leveling up&nbsp;</strong>required, and that’s what we did.</p>
<blockquote class="">
<p id="a233" class=""><em>You can read all about the best practices to design your API from scratch here:</em><a href="https://apimatic.io/blog/2018/03/building-rest-apis-the-right-way" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Best Practices to Increase API Adoption</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="035d" class="">Resources</h2>
<p id="e357" class="">A resource is one of the most essential part of&nbsp;<em>REST</em>. Resource is an object or representation of something, which has some data associated with it and there can be a set of methods to operate on it. According to&nbsp;<em>REST&nbsp;</em>the URI should only contain resources(nouns) not actions or verbs.<em>&nbsp;The paths should contain the plural form of resources and the HTTP method should define the kind of action to be performed on the resource</em>. We identified our resources to be:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><strong>Transformation:</strong>&nbsp;A single resource describing all the relevant information of the&nbsp;<em>Transformation</em>&nbsp;of an API description from one format to another. The transformation is tied to the&nbsp;<em>User</em>.</li>
<li><strong>API Entity Code Generation:&nbsp;</strong>A single resource describing all relevant information of a code generation performed from an API description already stored with us. The&nbsp;<em>API Entity Code Generation</em>&nbsp;is tied to the&nbsp;<em>API Entity</em>&nbsp;for which the SDK is generated.</li>
<li><strong>User Code Generation:</strong>&nbsp;A single resource describing all relevant information of a code generation performed from an API description provided by the user as file or URL. The&nbsp;<em>User Code Generation&nbsp;</em>is tied to the&nbsp;<em>User</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p id="e0cf" class="">The 3 new APIs are based on these 3 resources, with each resource having its specific API and each API having many endpoints. These corresponding database models of these resources were also added to the old CodeGen and Transformer APIs as well, to ensure&nbsp;<em>backward compatibility</em>&nbsp;for our public APIs. Increased our score from&nbsp;<strong>Level 0&nbsp;</strong>to&nbsp;<strong>Level 1</strong>. Are we happy with this? Yes; can we go higher? 100%.</p>
<h2 id="02be">HTTP Methods and Status Codes</h2>
<p id="e881" class="">HTTP has defined few sets of methods which indicate the type of action to be performed on the resources. The URL is a sentence, where resources are nouns and HTTP methods are verbs. Aspiring to achieve true RESTful-ness for our APIs we used HTTP methods instead of using a single method for all requests, for instance,&nbsp;<em>GET&nbsp;</em>when requesting resource and&nbsp;<em>DELETE&nbsp;</em>when deleting resources and so on.</p>

<div class="col-md-12 col-xs-12 col-sm-12">
<p id="dac4" class="">Similarly, HTTP has defined a bunch of standardized codes which let the client know the feedback, whether the request failed, passed or the request was wrong. For the sake of correct&nbsp;<strong>Developer Experience,&nbsp;</strong>our API should always return the right HTTP Status Code. e.g. 200 OK for successful retrieval of resource and 404 Not Found if the requested resource doesn’t exist.</p>
<h2 id="7ec4" class="">Content-Type based routing</h2>
<p id="a935" class="">While writing the new APIs we came across a few cases where we needed a different action performed for the same resource and the same HTTP verb e.g. creating (<em>POST</em>) a&nbsp;<em>Transformation&nbsp;</em>with a File and creating (<em>POST</em>) a&nbsp;<em>Transformation&nbsp;</em>with a URL. In such a case where we wanted even finer-grain control over the routing mechanics, we ended up routing them to different actions based on the content-type header. We implemented a custom version of the&nbsp;<em>Route</em>&nbsp;attribute which adds a Content-Type parameter that gets evaluated when a request is being routed. And now we had a single path (e.g. POST: “api/transformations”) that accepts both binary and JSON data and routes them to a different action.</p>

<div class="col-md-12 col-xs-12 col-sm-12">
<h2 id="1316" class="">Repository Design Pattern</h2>
<p id="4fbd" class="">The new APIs were implemented on the&nbsp;<em>Single Responsibility Rule&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Repository Design Pattern</em>. It leverages a layer that isolates the APIs from the details of database access code. In large systems such as ours adding this layer helps minimize duplicate query logic. The repository (or as it’s called in our codebase; a manager) acts as an in-memory object collection. Objects are added and removed from the repository and the code encapsulated by the repository carries out the appropriate operations behind the scenes. The API is completely unconcerned about the underlying mechanism of getting the data or even the kind of database being used; it could be a&nbsp;<em>MongoDB</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>SQL</em>&nbsp;database being accessed inside the repository using whatever&nbsp;<em>ORM&nbsp;</em>or<em>&nbsp;Querying mechanism</em>, the controller would just call the relevant method of the repository to get the data it requires.</p>
<h2 id="c7a1" class="">Documentation</h2>
<p id="c3be" class="">The new APIs were written to be self-documenting, we tried to make things as self-explanatory as possible. Here’s a work in progress version of a documentation generated using APIMatic tools:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apimatic.io/apidocs/apimatic/v/1_0#/java/getting-started">Preview Docs</a></p>
<p id="0401" class="">The taxonomy and naming convention we advised can easily be picked by documentation rendering tools to name our endpoints in a way that even a layman can understand.</p>
<h2 id="b3df" class="">Unit Tests</h2>
<p id="e1e6" class="">Writing unit tests for code results in fewer bugs in production and fewer bugs in production means more time for making cool new features. It’s usually good practice to have automated unit tests while writing code. Doing so helps find bugs early in the development cycle and saves time in the long run. These tests can be run multiple times to verify the behavior of a particular unit of code for different sets of input.</p>

<p id="2956" class="">Level 3, the highest level, uses HATEOAS to deal with discovering the possibilities of your API towards the clients. This is our end goal for the APIs to completely satisfy the REST constraints. We have already started working towards this.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.writethedocs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.writethedocs.org/">Write the Docs</a> is a global community of people who care about documentation. They boast a <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/">Slack network</a> of thousands of members and are physically present on 3 continents where they conduct regular meet-ups.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Our team ran into some members of the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.meetup.com/Write-the-Docs-SF/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.meetup.com/Write-the-Docs-SF/">San Francisco Chapter</a> earlier in the summer, and an arrangement was made for Nauman, our Product Manager to speak at their latest meet-up. With this talk, we aimed to introduce<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> the latest practices in API Documentation and explain what Developer Experience is for APIs.</strong></p>

<blockquote class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">“….APIs are not only for savvy developers or tech companies”</blockquote>
<p class="graf graf--p">The talk started off with how APIs are slowly taking over the world, and how it has become important for every business to have an API. The cyberspace is changing rapidly, and just like it was important for businesses to have a website a few years back, it’s important for them to have an API today to exist and stay relevant.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">APIs are not as easy to interact with and require prior documentation and know-how for third-party interactors to deal with, in the case of APIs, the third-party interactors being developers, which brings us to the concept of Developer Experience.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h4">What Exactly is Developer Experience?</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Developer Experience (DX) is the equivalent of User Experience (UX) when it comes to a developer.</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It is a concept often referenced in the API world and rightly so. APIs are complex structures and unless you properly explain what your API does, nobody is ever going to use it. In fact, the value of your API and the usage is something that directly depends on your Developer Experience.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Developers are the lifeblood of an API economy and until it is made easy for them to access and play around with your API, it may never really see success.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">A great Developer Experience is when even novice developers come to your API and require minimum onboarding time, no handholding, and achieve maximum satisfaction. Here, the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3:30:3 Rule is applied </strong>which a developer coming in of any experience should take:</p>

<ul class="postList">
 	<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">3 seconds to understand what your API does</strong></li>
 	<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">30 seconds to understand the required functionality</strong></li>
 	<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">3 minutes to be up and running</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">This should be the end goal of your entire Developer Experience campaign. These are the metrics you should measure your efforts against at end of the day. Companies like Stripe and Twilio have come close to this and have found massive success with their APIs.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h4">What Constitutes a Great Developer Experience?</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Great Developer Experience can be achieved with the help of the following components:</p>

<ul class="">
 	<li class="graf graf--blockquote">Getting Started Guides</li>
 	<li class="graf graf--blockquote">Client Libraries</li>
 	<li class="graf graf--blockquote">API Console</li>
 	<li class="graf graf--blockquote">Code Samples</li>
 	<li class="graf graf--blockquote">FAQs</li>
 	<li class="graf graf--blockquote">Change Logs</li>
 	<li class="graf graf--blockquote">Dashboard(Monitoring and Reporting)</li>
 	<li class="graf graf--blockquote">Authentication</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">It is essential to take the correct steps and measures throughout your API Lifecycle to ensure you end up providing a great experience. You can read in detail about the best practices you can <a href="https://apimatic.io/blog/2018/03/building-rest-apis-the-right-way/">follow throughout your API lifecycle</a>.</p>

<div class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed">
<p class="mod-reset">Your primary focus should be on getting your specification right and how that will drive your entire API Program. No matter what specification you are comfortable with, OpenAPI, RAML, or API Blueprint, you can convert back and forth as many times as you like with the API Transformer and can even integrate the Transformer API in your CI/CD cycle to convert specs on the go.</p>

</div>
<p class="graf graf--p">Coming to the consumption part, Twilio, Stripe, Algolia, and other API companies achieved their success by making their APIs super easy to consume. However, it is important to note that, for all of these companies, APIs are the bread and butter and they can afford to spend their entire resources towards a better Developer Experience. But traditional companies like banks, airlines, and telcos that are recently jumping into the API space or are opening up their API to wider audiences, may necessarily not have the expertise or the knowledge to pull of something similar.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">But that does not have to be the case anymore and that’s where APIMatic comes in. With us, you can produce everything that makes it easy for developers to consume APIs. You can provide a Developer Experience only parallel to the best in the industry. And all of that with the least of effort (in minutes) and least of resources. All you need to do is manage and maintain a specification, and let us do the rest.</p>
