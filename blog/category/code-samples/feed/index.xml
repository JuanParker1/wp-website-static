<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s it like to call your API? Developers want to use your API to accomplish something, and you want to make it as easy as possible for them to incorporate your service. To allow developers to call your API directly from any technology, your docs provide DIY instructions. To go a step further and give developers additional conveniences and tooling, you can provide Software Development Kits (SDKs). SDKs include code to call your API so that developers don&#8217;t have to write it themselves from scratch.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">While calling an API directly vs. using an SDK does not change the ultimate functionality of the API, it can dramatically affect the developer experience. In most cases, one method will be preferred over the other, varying according to each developer’s needs, preferences, and skills. An SDK offers simplicity and speedier development but applies only to a particular development framework. SDKs require resources to develop and maintain. Direct calls offer platform flexibility and are available to all developers, but are harder to use without expertise.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we&#8217;ll be looking at why your developer experience may focus on direct API calls, SDKs, or both.</span></p>

<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct API Calls: The Basics</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For communicating with a service, sending API calls directly to URL endpoints is the simplest way. Of course, when we say </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">simplest</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we mean in terms of program complexity, not ease of use.</span>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">When using an API without an SDK, you make calls to its URL endpoints directly using standard internet protocol commands for transferring packets of information over the network. There&#8217;s no abstraction between you and the service, so every parameter must be written into the call. It must also conform to a standard format.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of how to construct a direct API call using Python is shown in the code snippet below. Notice the URL for the API endpoint is specified explicitly, alongside required header parameters that describe the request. This information is bundled and transmitted using the <code>requests</code> library, which then receives any response data returned by the API and stores it in the <code>resp</code> variable. Note that the cost of deserialization is added here for the API call.</span></p>

<pre class=""><code class="language-python">import requests
from requests.structures import CaseInsensitiveDict

url = &quot;https://connect.squareup.com/v2/payments&quot;

headers = CaseInsensitiveDict()
headers[&quot;Square-Version&quot;] = &quot;2021-06-16&quot;
headers[&quot;Authorization&quot;] = &quot;Bearer ACCESS TOKEN&quot;
headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;application/json&quot;

resp = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
print(resp.status_code)

decoded = jsonpickle.decode(resp.text)
</code></pre>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another example of a non-trivial API call can be seen here, pulled from the User Authentication documentation for the</span> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dropbox API</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>


<figure id="attachment_1520" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1520" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1520 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dropbox-1024x677.png" alt="dropbox user authentication" width="790" height="523"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1520" class="wp-caption-text">Dropbox User Authentication Docs</figcaption></figure>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For many developers, the need to specify every parameter is exactly what they want: the full power of the service at their fingertips.</span>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-level control can be unnecessary and overwhelming, though, especially for new developers. With just the basic building blocks, it can become a challenge for developers to perform more complicated tasks.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only can direct API calls be complicated to do correctly, but they can also be frustrating to try to troubleshoot. API response codes aren&#8217;t particularly specific when providing error messages; Many developers may give up after countless generic 404 errors.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, many developers will wish they could have something a little more prepared for them. For those developers, you can please them by offering SDKs in their language.</span></p>

<h2 class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDKs: What Are They?</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDKs are a compilation of environment-specific developer tools designed to access your API. SDKs make it more straightforward for developers to use your API using a programming language framework they prefer. For the developer who wants a little more guidance, SDKs will be the most appealing way for them to access your service.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDKs abstract away the minutiae of the API that often bog down implementation for developers. They can be thought of as an API wrapper that makes accessing that API more friendly to a particular type of developer. A developer has to download and install an SDK that matches the language of their development environment, where it will then provide a host of streamlined functionalities for interacting with your API. If the developer is using Python, for instance, they’ll most likely download an SDK through pip, such as this example from </span><a href="https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/quick-start/tutorials/quick-start-with-the-api-client/python/?client=python"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Algolia’s documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>


<figure id="attachment_1521" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1521" style="width: 721px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1521 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/algolia-1024x350.png" alt="Algolia Documentation" width="721" height="247"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1521" class="wp-caption-text">Algolia SDK download through pip</figcaption></figure>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The example call to Dropbox&#8217;s API, shown earlier, constructed with their Python SDK is shown below. In contrast to a direct API call, it does not require the developer to hard code a URL and headers. Instead, the API token is passed to a provided client object that handles those details.</span></p>

<pre class=""><code class="language-python">import dropbox
token = &#039;My-API-Token&#039;
dbx = dropbox.Dropbox(token)

My_Field = dropbox.file_properties.PropertyField(&#039;Security Policy&#039;,&#039;Confidential&#039;)
My_Template_ID = &#039;ptid:1...&#039;
My_Property_Group = dropbox.file_properties.PropertyGroup(template_id=My_Template_ID, fields=[My_Field])

dbx.file_properties_properties_add(&quot;/my_awesome/word.docx&quot;, My_Property_Group)
</code></pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While APIs aren&#8217;t language-specific, SDKs are. A developer will download the SDK for the specific language they want to work with. API providers that intend to offer SDKs have to research what languages most appeal to their core user base. Developers who have the use of an SDK will be incredibly satisfied by the bevy of tools made available for them, including, but not limited to:</span>
<ul class="">
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autocomplete SDK commands inline</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code samples for commands</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example applications</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A beneficial everyday use case where SDKs are much easier to use than direct API calls is when developers need to perform complicated authentication procedures. Doing this correctly and securely with only direct API calls can be tricky, but most SDKs take these steps and make them easily implementable with just a few commands. The low-level API call parameters and structure are abstracted away from the developer and handled by the SDK.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In many ways, SDKs are the epitome of one of the main purposes of APIs: to give the developer the ability to build off existing technology as easily and quickly as possible.</span>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many developers, SDKs are the preferred method of interacting with APIs. For others, there are cases for making direct API calls without an SDK. Now that we&#8217;ve looked at both options let&#8217;s see why developers would lean towards one or the other.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing Between SDKs and Direct API Calls</span></h2>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an ideal world, there will be an SDK available to meet the developer’s exact needs. SDKs cost resources to produce and maintain, however. And even when SDKs are available, there are quite a few situations where the available SDKs might not work for what a developer wants to do. Just to list a few:</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An SDK may not be available in their desired language</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SDK may not be updated to incorporate new API features yet</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both of these situations, directly using the API might be the only option. After all, it takes time and effort for an API provider to build SDKs. If there&#8217;s only one Julia developer using your API who wants a Julia SDK, it might not justify the use of resources.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even for the SDKs of languages you deem popular enough to support, it takes time and effort to update those SDKs. Functionality added to an API yesterday may not be supported in the SDK by today.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the vast majority of use cases, developers will appreciate having SDKs available and will eagerly use them. This is especially true for those who are making use of multiple APIs in their applications. For that reason, SDKs are worth the time and effort to develop for your primary user groups. The effort it takes to provide up-to-date SDKs will save them effort as they can seamlessly incorporate API calls into their app code.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for those edge case developers, those who code in esoteric languages, those who need maximum security control over what the API is doing, and those who want to be on the cutting edge no matter what, direct API calls are most useful.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great example of a company showing both direct API and SDK calls in their documentation is </span><a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>


<figure id="attachment_1522" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1522" style="width: 576px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1522 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/stripe.gif" alt="Stripe API documentation showing both SDKs and API calls" width="576" height="296"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1522" class="wp-caption-text">Stripe API documentation showing both SDKs and API calls</figcaption></figure>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both direct API calls and SDKs are tools that you should make available in your developers&#8217; toolboxes. And the more tools at their disposal, the more effective your developers will be.</span>
<p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, the goal of your developer experience should be improving the accessibility of your product to developers of all backgrounds. Providing SDKs is the best way to make your API a little more manageable for them to implement.</span></p>

<p id="9c8b" class="">While APIs form an important part of modern software development, it’s crucial to ensure that the utility offered by an API does not come at the cost of hindered productivity. Often it takes developers multiple hours to get familiar with an API before they can start building and integrating with it, however, a great developer experience can ensure developers get started with the least of steps and minimal time. In this blog, we will discuss how code samples help contribute towards an outstanding developer experience. We will discuss in detail what makes good samples, the different styles of samples, and how samples gel in with documentation and other elements to form a formidable developer experience.</p>
<h2 id="74b0" class="">Part I: Code Samples — Why Should We Care?</h2>
<p id="6565" class="">Learning new technologies is a complex task, even for the savviest of developers. Often it requires them to go through in-depth documentation, guides, and tutorials, something which they are very keen to skip on. What code samples do instead, is provide them with a task-based learning activity, which requires concrete action.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Developers love learning by experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="60f5" class="">Developers are hands-on learners and code is another language they speak. When they see code, they want to try it, break it apart, put it into action. It’s their favorite call-to-action, often when figuring out if an API is the right fit for them, developers would have already tested out the code samples on developer portals to make their choice.</p>
<p id="d54b" class="">This was proved by a&nbsp;<a href="https://eventil.com/talks/PPSznP-jarod-reyes-how-twilio-writes-documentation">user study</a>&nbsp;conducted by Twilio, where they found that pages with lesser words before code, did better than pages with more sentences before code.</p>

<p id="0a22">Before we further talk about code samples, it’s important to understand the need for them in the first place. Why can’t developers do without them?</p>
<p id="3347">And it all starts with putting an API call together. A lot goes into an API call, all these protocols, and conventions, and developers get all caught up in it, instead of focusing on their actual projects. It can take developers multiple hours to figure out what to put into a call, taking a toll on their productivity and creativity and all adding up to integration time.</p>
<p id="e3da" class="">What code samples do is put there calls together for them, in languages of their choice, so they don’t have to do it. Nicely done samples can get developers to&nbsp;<strong>the first Hello World</strong>&nbsp;with an API without writing a single line of code. Samples that go beyond that can be put straight into production. Which now leads to our next question.</p>
<h3 id="0d90">How many code samples can you write?</h3>
<p id="cae9">Not enough! Especially if you are looking for coverage of every endpoint. APIs tend to change and evolve and to update the samples manually with every iteration, even you somehow managed to produce them is not feasible.</p>
<p id="226a" class="">A viable approach here is to auto-generate these samples using an out of the box documentation solution. Different tools have different ideas on how to package deliver these samples. While some do the bare minimum, others go the extra mile to see developers have to put in as little work to get them running. It’s important for API owners to select the right tool to provide the best samples to their consumers, it should be a top priority choosing a documentation solution.</p>
<h2 id="db1d">Part II : Code Samples — Several Different Styles</h2>
<p id="3b6d" class="">To help API owners make well-informed choices, we ran a study to compare this different style of samples, which we analyzed keeping in mind the following qualities:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><strong>Learning Objective</strong>&nbsp;— They demonstrate actual (non-theoretical) use of API</li>
<li><strong>Runnable</strong>&nbsp;— Are runnable out of the box on a console and IDEs</li>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong>&nbsp;— Come with a playground to tweak them around</li>
<li><strong>Language Idiomatic —&nbsp;</strong>Proper language Structure to gel in with production-ready applications</li>
</ul>
<p id="d76f" class="">We categorized our learning into 5 different styles, the summary of which is categorized in the table below:</p>

<h2 id="21f7">Part III: Making Code Samples Work in Production</h2>
<p id="77cf" class="">Looking at the different styles of samples, the question that now arises is how practical are these samples to use? Do they completely replace the need to code, or are they just a push towards the right direction? Do they fully demonstrate the use case for the endpoint? Or do they just explain the logistics of making an API call?</p>
<h3 id="d87e">Language Coded HTTP Snippets or More?</h3>
<p id="6704">If you closely look at many of the auto-generated samples, especially the styles 1 to 4, what they essentially do is eliminate the redundant work of configuring environments, and help consumers figure out what kind of syntax to use. However, when making real-world use of API, you need a lot more. Do these samples, which essentially lack language structure and look like language translated HTTP requests, cut it? The answer is<strong>&nbsp;NO&nbsp;</strong>and for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><strong>No Data Types:</strong>&nbsp;The samples takes input and output in the form of a string, leaving it to the consuming developers to write an efficient i/o mechanism to complete these requests. Often the fields inside the body are not documented.</li>
<li><strong>No Data Models:</strong>&nbsp;Modelling the JSON/XML as classes make it easier to deal with the data, both input, and output. These “models” add a whole different layer on top of the API, with your application having to interact with the model, instead of queried response in JSON or XML.</li>
<li><strong>No Validation and Error Handling:</strong>&nbsp;Since there is no proper I/O mechanism, and both inputs are taken and output returns in form of JSON strings, it’s impossible to validate the sent data and handle error cases to determine what went wrong with the request.</li>
</ul>
<p id="d900">To further demonstrate our point, we will write a&nbsp;<strong>Sample App&nbsp;</strong>to make a new&nbsp;<strong>pet&nbsp;</strong>entry to a store. The app will utilize Code Samples generated by&nbsp;<strong>Postman&nbsp;</strong>for the endpoint<strong>&nbsp;Add Pet.</strong></p>

<p id="e551" class="">Following which we wrote the code to take in input values for these attributes. Now that we ensured we took in these values, with their correct data types, how do we pass these in the request, since the request passes the arguments in the form of a string. Manually doing this was, of course, unfeasible and out of the question, so we had to write in an object to string mapper to do the job for us. This took in these various attribute fields and put them together in the form of a JSON string.</p>
<p id="b586" class="">It was at this point that we were able to achieve a business use case out of the sample. We could pass in the input parameters, with their correct types, concatenated as a JSON string and passed along with the argument. The model allowed us to keep local records of the sent values as well.https://blog.devapi.dream.press/media/a6a1ace16d322eaaf541f83acf4905f9</p>
<p id="4294" class="">Working with multiple endpoints and multiple models would have taken us even more time, depending on the use case and business logic. For instance, for the GET endpoints, we would have to write a string to object mapper to parse values from the response string back to our model. While the sample does a great job pushing developers in the right direction, it is clear that it is not a plug and play situation. Developers have to put in a lot of code to get the calls running, and have to figure out on their own what goes before or comes after the API call.</p>
<p><em>Now imagine if there were samples that could take care of all these logistics, you had to write no communication code at all, and could just plug and play a sample into action. The good news is, you no longer have to imagine. The language idiomatic samples generated alongside an SDK already do that for you.</em></p>
<h2 id="21e8">Language Idiomatic Code Samples — The Way To Go</h2>
<p id="b15b">SDKs have often been labeled as the cornerstone of the API developer experience. What SDKs essentially do is that they abstract out all underlying details of making an API call, making your API look like a library. They provide developers a complete framework to model their applications, including all the necessary dependencies, referenced libraries, system libraries, i/o mechanisms, and class models.</p>

<p id="4ce3" class="">Furthermore SDKs automatically format API responses to match the data types used in the programming language. They add an interface on top of the API, so your app interacts with the modeled data from SDK, instead of raw API arguments and responses. By providing SDKs, you can help developers focus on the business logic while taking care of API communication code.</p>
<p id="933e">Code samples generated with SDKs have a lot more work done on them. Since the SDK abstracts out request construction, none of the construction bit makes part of the sample, making the sample look very lean. Such samples can easily fit in with your applications in a very scalable manner, you only have to add minimal communication code, since there exist mechanisms to access, manipulate and work around with all the data fields, that go in and come out of an API call.</p>
<h2 class="has-text-align-center">. . .</h2>
<p id="308d" class="">Concluding this all, we strongly recommend that developers make use of code samples to consume APIs. No matter what style, design, or approach. Code samples will help you get started easily and save you tons of time. While for most people, the simple HTTP snippets may do the job, it is samples with more language structure that help with real-world use and can fit in straight with your applications.</p>
<p id="8467" class="">Again we emphasize the fact that the developer experience is a key driver for an API adoption. APIs are meant to execute integrations, and the easier to integrate, the better the API.

We did not pack our bags after <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.apimatic.io/developer-experience-portal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/developer-experience-portal">launching the first version</a> last month and are proud to present Developer Experience Portal Version 1.1. This time even more optimized, more beautiful, and more developer-friendly. The new version is packed with a number of improvements and some new features.</p>

<blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote">Read what makes APIMatic&#8217;s <a class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" href="https://apimatic.io/blog/2018/01//developer-experience-beyond-api-docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://blog.devapi.dream.press/introducing-portals-that-speak-your-devs-language-bac82a8c573f">Developer Experience portal different</a> from other available solutions.</blockquote>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">? Built from Ground Up to be&nbsp;Awesome</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">The new portal is written from scratch, based on our new internal <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Documentation Format </strong>that powers much of the interactive parts of docs such as the console and reactive code snippets.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This will enable us to implement more <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">complex features </strong>in the future without being limited by markup languages such as Markdown.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">The design of typography (textual elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, etc) has been overhauled. The new portal brings <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">massive improvements to the look of the content</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">?&#x200d;? Redesigned API Reference</h2>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">? <strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Switching between Languages</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Switching </strong>between languages maintains the endpoint or model or whatever section is open. Config in the console is also persisted between languages.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">? <strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Improved Embedded&nbsp;Mode</strong></h2>

</figure>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">? Quick&nbsp;Jump</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">We’ve added a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">fuzzy search </strong>that helps quickly jumping to endpoints and models. It can also be triggered from the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">keyboard </strong>using <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Ctrl+K</code>&nbsp;.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">? Faster,&nbsp;Lighter</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">The new portal is written to be fast and light. Despite adding new features, we’ve actually shed weight <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">resulting in about a 33% reduction in size</strong>.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The new portal optimizes for a perception of fast loading speed by delaying loading of non-critical components until they are needed. This results in <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">a 71% reduction in size on the first load</strong>.
